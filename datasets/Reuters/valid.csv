"U.S. APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE. In a bid to hasten Japan's promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar. Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides, Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention. ""That was no slip of the tongue,"" said one western monetary official, who asked not to be identified. For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon. The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from Japan, dramatic action is required. Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries. The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies. And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials. Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the deficit. ""I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,"" said one. In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting ""underlying economic fundamentals"" or economic reality. The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit. The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada, agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances. But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one. Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out. Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem ""to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for."" International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers, although Japan is an obvious exception. ""Everybody feels it can still be managed,"" one source said of market developments. But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other central banks about one billion dlrs. Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the Paris accord outright. The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it stood at when the accord was struck. The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a ""pointed reminder"" to Japan to do something about the trade issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen. By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar. Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth. But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement. ""There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances ought to be adjusted,"" one official said. ""While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,"" another U.S. official said. The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be joined by Italy, will be a status report. ""Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need to move faster,"" one source said. Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in effect, for currency stability for several months. This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit. His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the U.S. trade deficit.

Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has agreed to take over the outstanding 25 pct in <Deutsche Bank (Asia) AG>, the former <European Asian Bank AG>, from Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference. Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt. Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of Lloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said. Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell. <Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was acquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would be consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section ""participations,"" Christians said. But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation. Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.

"JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS. Japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market, while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture, a government report said. The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access. Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food. Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show. The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances. The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said. The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said. This could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure, the paper said. To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said.

"CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX. Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said. Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model, he said: ""All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987, compared with 1986,"" he added. Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group, increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after 11.7 pct in 1986. The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from 2.9 pct in 1986. ""Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand,"" Calvet said. ""This is a relatively new problem for us."" Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity. Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs. This weekend he said that those profit estimates ""remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."" Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months. The car has registered just over 20,000 sales. It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of 1,000 cars a day. The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa. The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: ""Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market.""

"LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87. Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said. Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates. The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985. Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: ""We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987."" Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg. On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln. According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

"BANK OF SPAIN GOVERNOR SAYS MONEY GROWTH TOO FAST. Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would succeed in restricting money growth. In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid Assets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of 17 pct in March, the same as in February. The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987 is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year. Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range. He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct real drop in the contribution of the external sector. The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.

""There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way,"" Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee. The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them, he said. Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power, but it is in a difficult position today, Volcker said. He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize Brazil's external payments. ""The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian authorities,"" he said. Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together, Volcker said. Regarding trade imbalances, Volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations. In addition, the United States must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies, Volcker said.

"HOUSE 0/92 FARM PLAN MARKUP DELAYED TILL TUESDAY. A House Agriculture Committee meeting to draft a disaster aid bill containing a controversial 0/92 provision has been postponed until next Tuesday, committee staff members announced. The bill contains a provision implementing a 0/92 acreage reduction plan for 1986 wheat and 1987 winter wheat, thereby making payments available to farmers who were not able to plant last year's winter wheat crop because of flooding. Controversy exists over whether the 0/92 provisions of the bill should be expanded, cut back or left as is.

"PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING. A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference. ""If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions, Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,"" he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market, he added. ""How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business?"" he said. The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said. The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades, gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins, dealers said. However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said. Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986. A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said. Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said. While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said. Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said. Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers said. Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant. Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers said. ""All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,"" Hofer said. ""I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market,"" he added. Officials of several major Japanese trading houses, attending the press conference, said they supported Credit Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.

"PLYWOOD CREDITS EYED BY REAGAN ADMINISTRATION. The Reagan administration is debating whether to provide government credit guarantees for the export of plywood, a U.S. Agriculture Department official said. As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not to provide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured products. However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product. Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture, tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear. ""As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity,"" Sims said in a telephone interview. Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under an export credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday. In its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offer included three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excluding plywood. However, Sims said he did not expect any plywood exports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer.

"INDONESIA OIL CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS END THIS MONTH. Negotiations between Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said. Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks. But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years. Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for. Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market.

"LMFE TO CONCENTRATE ON CASH SETTLED CONTRACTS. The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract from April 3, the LMFE said. The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the cash settled contracts introduced last year. ""This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts,"" LMFE official Peter Freeman said. ""These two have already shown their effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is increasing,"" he added. ""Using the futures market allows better planning and forward price fixing that our industry needs,"" chairman Pat Elmer said. Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and Livestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February, which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice the number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said. Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement.

"JAPAN ACTIVELY BOUGHT U.S. CORN LAST WEEK - TRADE. Japanese feed and starch makers actively bought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/September shipment in view of bullish freight rates following active inquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said. Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period. ""Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April,"" one source said. The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market.

"JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS. Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other. The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China. Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said. ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese government official said. ""But we are also frustrated."" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said. He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress. ""It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied. The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour. On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers. The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits. These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more. Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants. Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports. Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one Japanese official said. That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said. Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said. Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them. ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted. As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers. The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.

"EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA. The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

"NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE. Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said. The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements. ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters. An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said. The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago. ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),"" he said. In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted. Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales. These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year. AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins. Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990. Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.

"WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA. World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices. ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he said. He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.

"SOUTH KOREA TO PAY MORE FOR JAPANESE ETHYLENE. South Korea will pay about 20 pct more for ethylene imported from Japan in the second quarter of the year because increased plastic production in both countries has boosted demand and tightened supplies, chemical industry sources said.

South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has risen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month, and the country may face difficulties covering the extra volume, they said. <Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp>, a producer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene, will more than double its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from 4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this month, the sources said. <Honan Ethylene Corp's> import requirements have risen to 8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strong demand from <Honan Petrochemical Co>, which makes HDPE and ethylene glycol, and <Hangyang Chemical>, which produces low-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer, they said.

""And even if Japan had the additional ethylene, there is a logistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vessels to ship it to Korea,"" said one trading house source. Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative sources to supply South Korea's needs, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Mexico, they said. But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has to be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to keep it in a liquid form, they said. Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene industry in order to cope with the additional demand, despite rising prices, trading house sources said. South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase its ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year by the end of 1989, so the strong demand surge for imports is only a medium-term trend, they said.

"FRENCH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY. French industrial production fell a seasonally adjusted 1.98 pct in January after revised unchanged output in December, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE) said. The figure, which excludes construction and public works, put the January index, base 1980, at 99 after 101 in December. January output was 1.98 pct down on January 1986. INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980 from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on November, using the old base year. INSEE said production in January was affected by rail strikes and severely cold weather. It said output of gas and electricity was very high but activity slowed on construction sites, in quarries and in certain base industries.

The estimated 1986 results are based on 3,207,000 shares outstanding, compared to 2,566,000 shares outstanding for 1985. R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986 was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an increase in bad debt reserves. Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986. Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which were not adequate at the time of acquisition. He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second and fourth quarters. Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will be restated, though final net income for the year will remain in the estimated range. He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987 revenues were favorable.

"PERU ANNOUNCES LARGE NEW GOLD FIND. President Alan Garcia said Peru has found gold deposits worth an estimated 1.3 billion dlrs in a jungle region near the Ecuadorean border about 1,000 km north of here. He told reporters yesterday the deposits, located at four sites near the town of San Ignasio, contained the equivalent of 100 tonnes of gold. Garcia said the government would soon install a two mln dlr treatment plant at Tomaque. It will extract enough ore to provide an estimated 25 mln dlr profit by the end of this year, he added. Garcia said the other gold-bearing deposits are located at Tamborapa, Pachapidiana, and a zone between the Cenepa and Santiago rivers.

"VENEZUELA-ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION. Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) official said. ""We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected,"" he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today. He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite. He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market. Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd. He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil.

"UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE. Abnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said. It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said. The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months. The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said. The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.

"ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987. Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. ""The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen."" He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this ""radical elimination of the mortgages of the past"" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs.

"U.K. AVERAGE GDP RISES 2.6 PCT IN 1986. Britain's gross domestic product (GDP) on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by 2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier, Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show. In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter. The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based 1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against 113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of 1985. The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985. On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter, giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO figures show. On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the year-ago quarter. The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively. Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same 1985 quarter. The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter. The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9 against 109.4 a year earlier. For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose 2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985. The government usually considers the output measure the most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes. It is based on output data for production industry and partial information for the rest of the economy. The government had forecast that average measure GDP would rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct. The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices, rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a 2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985. Year-on-year, the deflator rose 3.7 pct.

"PUROLATOR <PCC> DIRECTOR QUITS OVER BUYOUT. A Purolator Courier Corp director resigned from the company's board, saying he plans to take steps to make or find an offer that tops the 265 mln dlr buyout deal already accepted by Purolator's board, the company said. The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in which the company would bought out by a group of its managers and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals. ""I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe, therefore, that I should resign as a director of the corporation,"" Gardner said in the letter. ""Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator Courier Corp, effective immediately,"" he said. Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier division. On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields, filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout. The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs in debentures and a warrant to buy stock in the new company in exchange for each share.

The Fed previously said the rate was 79.7 pct in January and 79.5 pct in December. A surge in automobile assemblies in February and a gain in primary metals production helped raise manufacturing to 80.1 pct capacity from 79.9 pct in January. Durables manufacturing increased to 76.8 pct last month from 76.3 pct in January, the Fed said. Nondurable manufacturing eased to 85.2 pct of capacity use from 85.4 pct in January. Last month's rate was down from 80.2 pct in February, 1986. Fabricated metals increased to 81.4 pct in February from 81.2 pct in January, while motor vehicles and parts jumped to 83.6 pct from 80.0 in January. Primary metals rose to 67.7 pct from 66.7 pct in January. Petroleum products fell to 92.5 pct in February from 94.5 pct in January. Capacity utilization for mining rose to 75.3 pct in February from 75.1 pct in January, but was below the February 1986 rate of 79.4 pct, the Fed said. The use rate for utilities was up to 80.8 pct last month from 80.4 pct in January. Producers of industrial materials operated at 78.9 pct of capacity, the same as in January and December, but down from the February 1986 rate of 79.6 pct.

Japan denied breaking a pact with the U.S. On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the accord. ""We are faithfully abiding by the ... Agreement but of course there are some problems,"" a spokesman for the International Trade and Industry Ministry told Reuters. He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products. ""We are aiming to reduce production in Japan but of course this takes time,"" he said. The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices, but added: ""It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem."" The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase U.S. Semiconductor sales in Japan.

"COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS. This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. ""The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again,"" a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. ""The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality,"" he said. ""Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks,"" the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis. ""There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement,"" he said. ""There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation,"" de Vries added. With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

The Transco pipeline system reached permanent take-or-pay settlements on about half its committed gas deliverability and interim agreements for another 38 pct of its deliverability, the annual report said. The company said it paid a total of about 363 mln dlrs to producers through Februry one out of its 550 mln dlr reserve to settle the take-or-pay disputes. Transco said its gas pipeline delivered more than 1.2 trillion cubic feet last year and its marketing affiliate sold an average of 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day. The company's exploration partnership received an average price of 1.84 dlrs per mln cubic feet for gas sales during 1986, down from 3.04 dlrs in 1985.

"JAPAN SAYS U.S.-JAPAN MICROCHIP PACT WORKING. Japanese officials sought to convince the U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case. ""We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact,"" Osamu Watanabe, Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division, told foreign reporters. ""The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place,"" he said. U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States. The agreement, signed last September, aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market. The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact, Watanabe said. Yukio Honda, director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division, denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries. MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market, Honda said. ""The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now, but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices,"" Honda said. MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States, he added. The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter, he said. Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls, regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results, Watanabe said. ""I am optimistic,"" he added.

"GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. Finance and economy ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration. But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system. The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion. He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia. Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year. The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System (EMS). Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state. They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms. He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

"COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS. Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's <Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said. As previously reported Comalco's <Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to <Columbia Aluminium Corp>. Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts. The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.

Speaking to the National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) convention here, Yeutter said he is ""cautiously optimistic"" the controversial oils tax proposal will be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers.

"DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987. Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say. Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government's response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy. Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates."" Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment. Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder. Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first. One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden. A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said.

"JAPAN OCTOBER/DECEMBER GNP RISES 0.8 PCT. Japan's gross national product (GNP) rose a real 0.8 pct in the October/December quarter after an upwardly revised 0.7 pct increase the previous three months, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said. The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been put at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2 pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September. In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7 pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst since 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed the strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry. In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/December quarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase in the previous three months, the Agency said. Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December, after a one pct rise the previous quarter. Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to real GNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2. The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding. In July/September, domestic demand contributed one percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off 0.3 point. Of the 0.2 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last quarter, falling exports knocked off 0.2 while falling imports contributed 0.4 point. Total export volume fell 1.2 pct quarter on quarter in October/December. Imports also fell, by 2.9 pct. Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand to October/December GNP growth, the private sector accounted for 0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2. The private sector contribution included 0.3 point for housebuilding, 0.4 for corporate capital outlays and 0.1 for stockbuilding. Consumer spending had a 0.4 negative impact.

"VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS. Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said. Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies. ""Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,"" Balletto said. Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output. He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln. Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976. ""If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,"" he said. ""This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,"" Balletto said. Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said. World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year. The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said. World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower. Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said. Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said. The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said. Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes. ""During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."" ""Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues. For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program. ""Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate."" The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.

"CONTINENTAL BANK/CANADA SETS DISTRIBUTION. Continental Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC <LLOY.L>, said it intends to redeem all existing preferred shares and distribute a stock dividend to common shareholders. The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II, which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive 12.75 dlrs for each share. Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends. Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of 72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at 12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive cash to do so. The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in early May, subject to various approvals. Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs, allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per common share. Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or early 1989. Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred shares, the bank said. The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank of Canada's sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC. Continental Bank said Lloyds Bank Canada paid the balance of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally anticipated since Continental was unable to transfer certain income tax deductions to Lloyds Bank.

"AUSTRALIAN METAL TRADER LINKS TO ASTURIANA DE ZINC. <Metal Traders Australasia Ltd> said a newly-formed subsidiary, the <Austmet Ltd> group, has negotiated an exclusive long-term contract with Spain's <Asturiana de Zinc> to market its zinc metal exports. Metal Traders said in a statement the contract would underpin the worldwide zinc, copper and lead trading activities of Austmet, a wholly-owned London-based company with a U.S. Unit in Stamford, Connecticut. Austmet has recruited a group of base metal traders, currently operating out of Britain and the U.S., Who have handled Asturiana's business for the past five years, it said. Asturiana has a three-year option to purchase 25 pct of the Austmet group, to be priced on an independent valuation at the time of exercise, Metal Traders said. Austmet will have an initial equity base of one mln stg, a turnover of 200 mln Australian dlrs rising to 300 mln in the first year, and credit lines of up to 30 mln U.S. Dlrs. Austmet should be generating profits from July 1 and a 1.5-2.5 mln dlr net is envisaged within two years, it said. Metal Traders said Asturiana has the largest zinc smelting capacity in Europe -- nearly 200,000 tonnes a year of 99.995 pct high-grade zinc, at Aviles in northern Spain. Metal Traders, a listed company, was formerly <Pyrotech Resources N.L.> whose chief activity was the development and marketing of high-technology smelting processes invented in Australia, notably the Siromelt Zinc Fuming Process. But in late 1986, control of the company changed and it expanded by acquisition into metal trading in Australia and Asia. It then changed its name. It also has the marketing contract for mineral sands produced by <TiO2 Corp N.L.>, of which it holds 17.5 pct. In today's statement, Metal Traders also said it is reviewing possible acquisition of a mineral producer.

"U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT. Senior U.S. Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth. By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments. He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely. Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."" He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding, ""It looks like they're on track."" While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit, Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact. The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives, he said. ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family."" Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit. In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same. ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said. ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added. However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided. ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit) are unpleasant,"" he said. Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread distrust of government. ""The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level,"" Penner said. ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot."" Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year. He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed. ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said. Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets. ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said.

"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA. The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said.

"UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN. William Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade. He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming ""one of the world's industrial lightweights."" Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement. The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors. But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors. Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action, ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping. Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the U.S. industory more competitive. But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry. Bywater said, ""I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).""

"MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT. The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE) will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week. Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December, 1985. The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of 55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages. Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated by the symbol ""HF,"" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of March, May, July, September and December. Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation of one dlr per CWT. ""We hope the producers and users of fructose will be actively involved, those producers being the large processors, the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage bottlers,"" Henderson said.

"BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES. British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said it intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co <SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted. The offer would be made through its <BP North America Inc> unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares being tendered. BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based on its own valuation as well as those of its financial advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and non-public information. Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down 1-3/4 dlrs. BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at last night's close. About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's own resources. The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The company said it was in the course of arranging these facilities. BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be made without the limitations of a minority interest. BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the investment. Walters added that it also felt that, due to management changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even in a lower oil price environment. Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs. Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise. One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group should spend so much money buying a company it already controlled. BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago. It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the 1987/88 financial year, analysts said. Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would depend on the reaction of the markets. The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59 pct from 20 pct currently, he said. However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from its cash flow -- were good. Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted. Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from production and its downstream activities would push it comfortably into surplus. BP initially took a stake in Standard following the discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard, which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude oil. The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management reorganisation of Standard in the past year. The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the tender offer, Spedding said. BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well received in the markets. The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by other sectors.

"U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS. Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate. Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate. The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said. The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

"CBT TRADERS SAY U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL. The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said. Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin new crop futures, they said. New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures, since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land.

"BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: ""We don't have a target for the dollar."" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We really don't talk about the dollar."" He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries. ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong,"" he said. ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said. While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said. ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the interview. Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries.

"AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES. The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said. ""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year,"" he said in a statement. He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes. Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said. However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said. Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes. But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available. In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop. Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data.

"CATTLE BEING PLACED ON FEED LIGHTER THAN NORMAL. Most of the cattle now being placed on U.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on feed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply. The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements reported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock analysts said. After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in seven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a 15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago. Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter cattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally placed on feed. Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to obtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas. The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots, helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from February, 1986. University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes said, ""The probabilities are high that in order to place that many cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to lighter-weight cattle. The only statistics available are from some terminal markets which represent only a small percentage of the total cattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs in February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said. Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed, Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced. If the average weight is down, and there is no price weakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at lighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as three pct. Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly LBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly because of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle prices. Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain supplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from wheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said. Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions. Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and Graham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his area benefited from a dry, mild winter. To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.

"COCOA COUNCIL CHAIRMAN SEEKS BUFFER COMPROMISE. International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement. Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters. Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems. Producers and consumers indicated support ""in principle"" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group, consumer delegates said. Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends, but certain technical points need further clarification, the delegates said. Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities, consumer delegates said. Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are normally required by manufacturers, they said. Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would depress prices, they added.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. ""The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports,"" said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. ""In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,"" said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of ""big-ticket"" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. ""The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,"" said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. ""A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense,"" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. ""We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes,"" said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.

"U.S. TO ALLOW TEMPORARY IMPORTS OF S.A. URANIUM. The Treasury Department said it would temporarily permit imports of South African uranium ore and oxide pending clarification of anti-apartheid sanctions laws passed by Congress last fall. The decision was announced late Friday. It applies, until July 1, to uranium ore and oxide imported into the U.S. for processing and re-export to third countries. The Treasury said it took the action because it felt that when Congress passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall over President Reagan's veto it had not intended to hurt U.S. industry. In addition, the Treasury said it would permit U.S.-made goods to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing.

"PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986. The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact on Venezuela."" PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said.

"FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT. The Federal Reserve's move to easier monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter, analysts said. A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy. ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Stone said economic data available by late June may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point, to avoid hurting the dollar further. All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged. The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct. Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to the April-June quarter, follow: - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect. - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range. - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up. - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year. - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct annual rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter. ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter economic growth, with consumer spending helping later. ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest. Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively. He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative. Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth. He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds, with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct, respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate. Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20 pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct. Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct. The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S. trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers. ......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS.... ....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime.. Nikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..

Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one to shareholders of record April 15. The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and increased reserves for previously announced discontinued shipyard operations. In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving credit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln. The reduction will hold through May 15, it said. Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented it from violating covenants of its credit agreement. The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15. Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the U.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under completed ship construction contracts and a general decrease in U.S. military spending.

"TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN. The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said. The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade. ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, Baker International <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor. Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs. The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co <HT> figures show. The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said. Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said. ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt. Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock. ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said. ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity,"" according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs. Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said. Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

"U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER. Tonight's American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27, analysts and traders said. They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3 and four mln barrels. Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower. For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged. API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels. The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call. Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27. API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by less than one pct for the week ended March 27. Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already partially reflected in today's gains, they added.

"EXXON (XON) SEES SYNFUELS ROLE BY YEAR 2000. Development of costly shale oil, liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels, halted in recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies, will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a barrel, an Exxon Co USA executive said. Joe McMillan, a senior vice president, told Reuters after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, ""By early in the next century, synthetics should play a significant role in this country's energy supply."" McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range. ""You're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but I think that time is coming and we've got to be prepared,"" McMillan said. He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. By the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, McMillan said. Ashland Oil, Inc. chairman John Hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels. The United States, Hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world's known oil reserves. ""We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later,"" Hall said. The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years. Until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil. The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.

"U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS. The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security. The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit. The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries. Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year. ""This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,"" the Washington Democrat said. The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls. Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments. It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.

"ECONOMISTS CUT AUSTRIAN GDP GROWTH FORECAST. The Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December. WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added. A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year. Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings. Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2 pct last year due to the slack economic activity. Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's central bank, last month forecast the current account would be roughly in balance this year. However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9 pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he said.

"FED'S JOHNSON STRESSES PRICE STABILITY. Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made. ""It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth,"" he told the Eastern Economic Association. Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts. ""Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction,"" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Canada. On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending. There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said. But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable. ""This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending,"" he said. A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed, Johnson said. He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth. On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against ""quick fix"" solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation. ""What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth,"" he said. Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time.

"RENISON GOLDFIELDS EXTENDS LYELL COPPER MINE LIFE. The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd <RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open for an extra five years following a new aid package from the state government, RGC said in a statement. The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994. The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said. Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000 tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said. The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast of Tasmania. The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10 mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.

"ROYAL BANK/CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH. Royal Bank of Canada's <RY> small Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada (Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada, Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said. ""They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the Canadian market because it's an untapped market,"" Brennan told reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of Commerce. Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like paper machinery and ships to Canada. He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an agreement reached in January with international financial authorities. Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada reached about 700 mln dlrs. Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986 ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much because of the country's uncertain financial climate. Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank of Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said. Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a position to resume debt repayments within a year. Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada.

"INDONESIAN RUPIAH SLIPS AGAINST MARK AND YEN. The Indonesian rupiah has held steady since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago, but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against the yen, according to central bank figures. In the past month, the rupiah has fallen five pct against the yen. Today's middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against 1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in September. Bank Indonesia's quoted rate for the dollar, the main currency for Indonesia's oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0 today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation. The rate for the West German mark was 913.28 today, a sharp drop from September when it was 786.06. The British pound has risen to 2,657.93 against 2,429.83. The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of currencies by the central bank. The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels. Its total disbursed foreign debt is estimated by the World Bank at 37 billion dlrs. Japan is one of Indonesia's key trading partners, taking half its oil exports.

"CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS. Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action ""would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same,"" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. ""They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,"" said Pulcine, ""and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not."" Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp <CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. ""In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks,"" said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, ""wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position."" Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. ""I think that is just for the benefit of the public,"" Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. ""From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money,"" said Meredith. ""My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings."" Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23; 2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. ""If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario,"" Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that ""it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year."" He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.

"YUGOSLAVIAN OIL FIRM STARTS WORKING WITH FRENCH. Yugoslavia's top oil and natural gas producer <Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern <Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said. Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France. Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs. Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> two years ago. Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects, involving Yugoslavia's other main producer <Naftagas> of Novi Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said. Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year. Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's leading export enterprises. In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there. Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest about 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area. Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the Tunisian government, has transferred one third of its option rights in the region to Ina, it said.

"SOLAR SYSTEMS <SSDN>, INKEY OF SPAIN SET PACT. Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain. It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the condoms made by INKEY. The company also said it is changing its name to Eurocapital Corp shortly. Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a U.S.-based <Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are being developed by INKEY.

It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval process to be a lengthy one. The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been tested in a spermicide. Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand name, ""Carlton."" The exclusive distribution contract for the products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year periods, the company said. It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have not gone on sale in other European countries. It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from the FDA. The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar Systems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below its current 45 pct.

"SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR. Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: ""Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based."" Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: ""While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry."" It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.

"U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK. U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said. ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said. ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added. Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"" Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level."" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support. ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.

"BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT. Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added. ""We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,"" Nogales said. ""Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all."" ""The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,"" he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government's first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level. He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates.

Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American Games, he said. He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving electronic features is being readied for test marketing this summer, and if successful, could ""materially benefit"" operations. Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said. Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects the division to receive significant contracts in the near future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog stood at 425 mln dlrs. Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln dlrs at 1986 year end. ""We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down in the very near term,"" based on strong cash flow from Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said. Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a company spokesman said.

Miyazawa told an Upper House session the six nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany -- are abiding by the Paris accord. The six agreed to cooperate to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels. Miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major nations (G-7) expected just before the IMF/World Bank Interim Committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9. The sources quoted Miyazawa as saying Japan is trying to prevent a further rise of the yen. Japan is taking the matter seriously, he added. Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar at about 153 yen, the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris talks, Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any mention of specific rates would create an ""unexpected situation.""

"U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE. Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived. For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork."" Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product. Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said. Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said. USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products. Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

"MADRID METRO HALTED AS SPANISH STRIKES SPREAD. An estimated 1.2 mln metro users in Madrid were stranded today as striking railway workers halted the underground transport system, industry sources said. The strikers joined coal miners, steel and oil refinery workers in Spain's latest wave of stoppages over wage demands. Some 10,000 pitmen in the northern province of Leon entered the second day of an indefinite stoppage to demand wage rises and a five-day working week, the sources said. Oil refinery workers picketed the state-owned Empresa Nacional de Petroleo SA (EMP) to prevent fuel lorries leaving the company's largest plant in Puertollano, central Spain. Paramilitary police were guarding steel mills at Reinosa, in northern Spain, from the daily protests against planned job cuts. A local government official said the police force would remain in place until tempers had cooled down. More than 60 people were injured in pitched battles between police and steel foundry workers in Reinosa last month.

Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer on March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops stock be tendered by the close of the offer. Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier today indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares, or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares outstanding. Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares, which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it a 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.

The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports,"" the editorial said. ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added.

"FRANCE TO SELL STAKE IN SOCIETE GENERALE UNIT. The French government is to sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe Generale <STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary <Societe Generale Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL officials said. SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. ""This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,"" he said. Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs. Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce its existing strong points, with no major projects planned apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch. SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

"IMPERIAL OIL <IMO.A> IN TALKS WITH SUPPLIERS. Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct-owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is negotiating with it major crude oil suppliers concerning the effects of a trial deregulation of Alberta's shut-in crude oil production, scheduled to be implemented on June 1, a company spokesman said. ""From our point of view, it's a question of entering into negotiations or discussions to make appropriate changes to contracts to reflect the changes that are going to take place on June 1,"" spokesman John Cote told Reuters in reply to a query. Commenting on published reports that Imperial had suspended its oil supply contracts, Cote said: ""It's not a question of cancelling or suspending any of the agreements at this point."" On June 1, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board will lift its crude oil marketing prorationing system, regulating shut-in light and medium crude production, on a trial basis to the end of 1987. Under the new system, producers and refiners will be allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered under purchase contracts. Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners. ""We have talked to a number of our major suppliers, and we've discussed the upcoming change with them, but nothing has been finalized,"" Imperial's manager of western crude supply Gary Strong said. Under Alberta's trial system, Imperial wants to match a reasonable supply of crude against the company's forecast demand for its refineries, Strong said. ""We have to know what they have and how that relates to what we need in total,"" he said. Strong said figures on the amount of crude production Imperial purchases from outside suppliers were not immediately available.

"STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES. A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics. The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct. He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October. Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include: - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period; - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current ""Buy America"" and ""Buy Canada"" provisions with a ""Buy North America"" provision; - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation; - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers; - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes. Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties. The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct. He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage. Wonnacott said ""bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers. He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production. Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product. Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations.

Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L> which earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over 1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting. The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc <DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most profitable retailing group in the U.K. It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses. Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger talks with the high street pharmacist <Underwoods Plc> had been called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended offer for <Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>. The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of 45.5 mln making it the largest single component. The company said that the improvement had been achieved by substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins. In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln. The company said its property operations would increase substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with developers <Rosehaugh Plc>. The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge. The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts. As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.

"IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS. Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade. A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front. It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf. Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said.

"MALAYSIA BAILS OUT ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BANK. Malaysia's central bank said it acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing <United Asian Bank Bhd> (UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to rebuild public confidence in it. UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49 mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement. But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the Indian Government. Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of 228.74 mln ringgit. It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold. The central bank early this week also announced that it had bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank, <Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year. Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the shares of the two banks. ""The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the stability of the these banks,"" it added. The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an ailing bank or to buy a stake in it.

"JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY. Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.9 pct in February from the record 3.0 pct in January, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. The January level was the worst since the Goverment started compiling unemployment statistics under the current system in 1953. Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier. Unadjusted February unemployment totalled 1.86 mln people, up from 1.82 mln in January and 1.64 mln a year earlier. Male unemployment in February remained at 2.9 pct, equal to the second-highest level set in January and December. Record male unemployment of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986. Female unemployment rose to a record 3.1 pct in February from the previous record 3.0 pct marked in January 1987 and in April, August, September and December last year. ""Japan's employment condition was still severe in February as the non-rounded rate of unemployment in February fell only 0.03 percentage points to 2.93 pct from 2.96 pct in January,"" an agency official said. Employment in manufacturing industries fell 430,000 from a year earlier to 14.22 mln people in February due to the yen's continued appreciation, while employment in non-manufacturing industries rose 380,000 to 12.11 mln. In manufacturing industries, employment in the textile industry fell 180,000 to 1.94 mln in February, while in ordinary and precision machinery industries it fell 160,000 to 1.50 mln.

""The course of Fed policy is quite adequate as far as we are concerned,"" Baker said in an interview with the New York Times. In the interview, Baker declined to comment about the recent Paris accord among the six leading industrialized democracies when he was asked why the U.S. agreed to stabilize the dollar at current levels when the trade deficit hit a record level last year. Baker said in the newspaper interview that it was ""a subject I prefer not to talk about."" He said that if he explained why the U.S. agreed to help maintain the dollar at current levels ""I would of necessity end up getting into some of the private agreements that support such and agreement"" on the dollar. Baker was optimistic about Brazil, which has stopped interest payments on much of its outstanding debt with foreign commercial banks. ""They are, after all, paying on time all the debt service and principal on their official debts, having just rescheduled with the Paris Club,"" Baker said in the newspaper interview.

"U.S. SOY PRODUCERS THINK EC OILS TAX UNLIKELY. American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said. Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch. After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries. ""Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"" he said. ""The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,"" Bennett added. Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said. The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said. The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added. The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said. ""We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures,"" Bennett said. ""The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist, and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"" he added.

"ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE. Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors. Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive. It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries. In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said. There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.

K Mart Corp said its record fiscal 1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs a year ago, marked a ""major turning point"" for the world's second biggest retailer. K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from ""merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."" A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago. K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said ""the success of these programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached this milestone."" Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8 billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over 1985, it said. Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, ""a marked increase in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from specialty retailing operations."" K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from 372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8 pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in 1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct. K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct in 1985. ""Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K Mart,"" Fauber said in a statement. ""In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on changing the look of our stores and the structure of the company."" K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system, upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured its long-term debt. ""We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985, our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct for the long term,"" the K Mart chairman said.

"AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT. Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue. Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers. Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient. The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct. Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further. Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said. Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries. But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first. Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.

"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER. Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April, trade sources said. They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February. The new forecast is still higher than last season's record total production. Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates. Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires. The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares. The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm. Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates. The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts. In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged. The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios. The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86. The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes. This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes. The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods. A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields. The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes. The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown. The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season. Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

"WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES. West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the usual interim period. A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F> and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally. The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks. A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking Association said. But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future, he said. He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate. The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct. Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline.

"THYSSEN SEES GOOD 1987 PROFIT DESPITE STEEL LOSSES. Thyssen AG <THYH.F> said it expects to post a good profit in 1987 despite anticipated losses in its mass steel-making operations this year. Managing board chairman Dieter Spethmann told the annual meeting the group was satisfied with profit developments in the first half of the 1986/87 financial year to September 30. The group's other three divisions -- specialty steel, capital goods and trading -- had made a profit so far in 1986/87, he added. Spethmann said income from associate companies had also been good in early 1986/87. In 1985/86 Thyssen's world group profit fell to 370.1 mln marks from 472.4 mln in 1984/85, reflecting costs linked to its steel operations. The company's dividend was an unchanged five marks. A Thyssen spokesman told Reuters that planned job cuts at subsidiary Thyssen Stahl AG would be higher than announced earlier. Total job losses by 1989 were now expected to total up to 7,800 against original projections of 5,900. Thyssen Stahl employs some 40,000 people.

However, financial market sources said they had heard the ministry has asked life insurance and securities firms to refrain from selling dollars, but they were unable to confirm this directly. Dealers said life insurance firms were not major sellers of dollars in recent trading sessions because they had already sold them to hedge risks.

"PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to."" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for"" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's current level, adding that ""It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level."" He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. ""There has been a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,"" Lawson said. He disagreed with what he termed ""the grossly exaggerated claim"" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that ""over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation."" He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP ""is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine."" He added that ""to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation.""

Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly 29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from 42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks. The group balance sheet, including for the first time VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9 billion marks, Luckey said.

Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct. Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own account contributed to record operating profits. Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said. Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.

The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987, Taylor said. Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities, Taylor said. Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small extraordinary gain.

"GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF. Debt among African countries will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said. He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries. Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo. ""I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries,"" Mamman said. ""The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries."" Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990. Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990. ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness, he said. ""The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports,"" he added.

The upcoming five-month deficiency payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash and half in generic commodity certificates, a senior Agriculture Department official told Reuters. Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates, or ""certs,"" will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16, Tom von Garlem, Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDA's state and county operations, said. The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer program, von Garlem said. get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman). Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments.

"JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT. Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said. December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953. ""There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,"" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions. ""At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,"" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. ""The three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used,"" one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said.

The agreement, approved by the U.S. Department of Justice yesterday, will give the merged company, Baker Hughes, six months instead of three to sell certain assets.

""Hughes will work with Baker and the Justice Department towards negotiating the final form of the consent decree and filing it as soon as possible,"" the company said in a statement.

One company being studied could possibly be acquired on a friendly basis, he said. Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares. Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said the such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current marketing capability would not be sufficient to support distribution of the company's products, given ICN's expectations for market growth worldwide. ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known as Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and described as a broad-based anti-viral. The company has said its possible applications include treatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza, childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers. ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in recent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical trials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases. Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its review of data submitted by the company. He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a House Subcommittee is continuing. The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.

"SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit. ""The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"" he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.

"ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS. Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week""s earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months, energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said. Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period. He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country.

"BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY. inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis. Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate. But within a year the plan has all but collapsed. ""The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked,"" a leading bank economist said. The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt. For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas contracts between producers and pipelines. It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by Commissioner Charles Stalon. FERC said in a press release that ""the proposed policy statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."" FERC added that ""specifically, in cases where pipelines assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the remaining costs through their demand rates."" It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming existing contracts to help spread the impact of these take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way. Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said ""this proposal represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the industry through this difficult period of transition to a more competitive market.""

"MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT. The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls. The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one. The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (""may sell"") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (""may buy"") price (171 cts) for six months. If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement. Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18. Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends. As in the present accord the ""may buy"" and ""may sell"" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the ""must buy"" and ""must sell"" levels at 20 pct of it. The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months. During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes. The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes. Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price. At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created. Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked ""relatively well."" Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the ""must buy"" level. They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber. In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. ""It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,"" one delegate said. The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year. To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports. Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place. The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it.

"NO PESSIMISM FOR GERMAN EXPORTERS, MINISTRY. Firms need not be pessimistic about export prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry said. The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986. But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand. Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. ""This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps,"" he said. The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade, he added. Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery times and good service. Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures. It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's exporters. Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas, tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

"PHILIPPINE COFFEE EXPORTS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY.

He said exporter registrations dropped from an average weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86. ""Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices, it has become difficult to service exports,"" de Guzman said, adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.

DLR FALLS ON FEAR TOKYO WON'T HIKE DEMAND-MIYAZAWA. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand. He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget. The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.

"JAPAN CANNOT BEAR FURTHER YEN RISE, MINISTER SAYS. Japan cannot bear a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said. ""A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden,"" he told reporters. The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus. Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax. If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said. Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner. But, he added, ""If the issue of rice is to be raised...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people."" Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive.

"WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA. Shifts from mild to very cold weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said. In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year. He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north. Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added. The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley. Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields. The officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.

"ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA. Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake, deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said. Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market. Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but would intensify its efforts where it already had stores. During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76 in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada and the U.K. ""We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London for example and it is reasonable that we might open other stores in other European countries in 1988,"" Fields said.

"BP UNITS SEEK FIVE BILLION DLR REVOLVING CREDIT. BP International and BP North America are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger. The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own for 70 dlrs a share cash. The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be used to support that program. The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and the dealers have not yet been chosen. The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks committed to the facility. Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility, Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among BP's relationship banks. As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at 75 mln. Although pricing on many credit facilities has become extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about 10 days.

"MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT. The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend. The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June. The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69. ""It's got 69 cents written all over it,"" one dealer said. Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release. The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March. Banque National de Paris <BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries. Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow. <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January. But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. ""We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,"" Buttrose said. Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added ""Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets)."" ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January. Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65. Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday. The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said the current account data had little impact on trading.

"GATT WARNS U.S. ON FEDERAL BUDGET, PROTECTIONISM. The United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit, the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said. By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year, the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system, it said in an annual report. The fundamental problem, the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit, could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt, it said. GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years. GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings, lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit. Raising U.S. Trade barriers ""would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit. It would, however, increase inflation and reduce world trade,"" it said. ""The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain,"" the report said. GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar, risk of higher U.S. Inflation, concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism. The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan, West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986. The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies, it added. ""Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year,"" the report said. GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar. ""Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates, which, in turn, would adversely affect world trade."" But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States, despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive. It suggested that resources idle in the U.S., Both human and in underutilised factories, were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad. World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986, about half of the rate of the previous year. Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct, continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade, GATT said. Developing countries' exports declined significantly, while their imports increased moderately, although full statistics are not available yet, GATT said. The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower, and only five of them (Chile, Colombia, Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand) had higher exports.

"U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA. The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments. In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now. Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said. The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill. Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist. The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower. For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991. The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said. Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry. He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads. U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing. Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar. USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.

"DIAMOND SHAMROCK <DIA> SEES BETTER 1987 EARNINGS. Diamond Shamrock Corp, which will split this month into two separate companies, expects to show improved earnings in 1987 over last year, executives of the new company told Reuters. Charles Blackburn, president and chief executive officer of Diamond Shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize exploration and production, said, ""Earnings wil be better than in 1986."" He declined to say how much better. In 1986 Diamond Shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. Exploration and production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs. Roger Hemminghaus, Diamond Shamrock vice president and soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said, ""Refining and marketing is a margin business. The margins will return and this will be a better year than 1986."" In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of 40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs. ""We are also expecting to be in the black in the first quarter (1987),"" Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986, the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs. The executives were in New york for meetings with institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the company's stock. On the New York Stock Exchange, Diamond Shamrock was trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4. Earlier this year, T. Boone Pickens offered 15 dlrs a share for Diamond Shamrock, and management countered with an offer at 17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing operation to its shareholders.

"FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY. U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is ""on hold"" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said. ""The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy,"" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. ""These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change,"" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3. February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target. ""In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth,"" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy. ""Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct,"" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.

"FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS. The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said. Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains. Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split. However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs. Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market. Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to ""as soon as five months after harvest as possible,"" rather than the current year lag time. Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985. Williams also said the previously announced sale of its Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week. The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January. In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2 mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs. Williams said the charges in the current year were related to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook for future stability and growth in earnings. Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales.

"BANK OF FRANCE SEES CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL PICKUP. The Bank of France expects a continued revival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for any improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate remains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review. The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the agro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall in January, while construction and civil engineering experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the next few months. Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in particular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said. Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception of the agro-food industry, improved substantially. In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last months. Production rose in all sectors except agricultural machinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship construction, where it declined. The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in activity in February, with both domestic and export orders rising. In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite a fall in the household goods sector and stability in pharmaceuticals. Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped by a strong growth in construction materials. But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over the past two months.

"SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL. Saudi Arabia has dropped its condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, the state-oil company, Petrobras, said in a statement. Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees. Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks. Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers. The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled. The shipment is part contract signed in February for the Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until June.

It also said that Shell Canada exercised its option to take over Solv-Ex's 25 pct working interest in the construction of the oil facility, relieving it of its obligation to raise about 62.5 mln Canadian dlrs for plant construction.

"U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs. For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said. During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs. The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance. The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each. Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan. On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports. Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought. Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter. The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter. In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs. Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs. Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct. The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.

"TEXAS COMMERCE <TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987. Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with Chemical New York Corp <CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs. Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase. ""We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger,"" Love said, referring to Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical. The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points, Love said. The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective January 1. Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas' struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc <ALBN> lost 17.6 mln dlrs, MCorp <M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5 mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation <FBT>, which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln dlrs. Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987. ""I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,"" he said. ""The fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans."" In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct. More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans, which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln dlrs the year before, were in real estate. Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four years, he said. ""I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel,"" he said. Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business, Love said. ""We are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,"" he said. In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area, and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks, he said. One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced in December, InterFirst Corp <IFC> and RepublicBank Corp <RPT>, both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs. The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. ""We think we can try to get a little part of their roost,"" he said. The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an edge in developing new consumer products, he said. ""We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,"" he said, referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking.

Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved performance was mainly due to product prices falling more slowly than crude prices during the year. He added that total sales volume increased as a result of higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels.

"SOUTH AFRICA GDP UP 4.7 PCT IN 1986 LAST QUARTER. The South African Reserve Bank, confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct in the 1985 final quarter. The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 1.5 pct contraction in 1985. But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad. GNP includes such payments or outflows. The bank also said there were indications the country's economic recovery was becoming more broadly based. With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production. The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987. Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February. Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70 billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total annual value of import payments. The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year. The bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be ""rebuilt to more comfortable levels."" ""This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for,"" the bank said.

"COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE. International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said. Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market. Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

"TAIWAN SEES ITS INVESTMENT IN U.S. RISING SHARPLY. Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Is expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991, a five-year forecast by the Economic Ministry showed. Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln dlrs, the ministry document said. The investment was mainly in electronics, trading, food and service industries. Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial Development and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among Taiwanese to invest abroad. Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or June, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10 mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln. He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are part of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with Washington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.

"ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS. Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents. The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16. Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output. Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461. Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year. Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable. Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1. Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock. Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending. Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing. ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb. A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636. In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices. To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said. The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said. But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines. Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said. Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota. Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987. He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports. He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate. Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs. Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year. ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period. The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures. They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion. The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan. Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.

"POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION. Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. ""Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,"" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. ""We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,"" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. ""Money seems to be chasing yields,"" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a ""bull flag"" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. ""It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,"" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. ""At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,"" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. ""We may still probe to see what the parameters are,"" Byers said, ""but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene)."" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level.

"ZAMBIAN MINISTER CONFIRMS COPPER DIVERSION. Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic. He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an interview the government was diverting all mineral exports along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports, but he said there had not been any problem with the new arrangements. ""So far our copper has been reaching its destinations without hindrance,"" he told the Times. The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports. Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.

The department said exporters also reported corn sales of 143,000 tonnes for delivery to Taiwan, with 56,000 tonnes for shipment in the 1986/87 season and the balance for shipment in the 1987/88 year. The marketing year for corn began September 1. Sales of corn to the USSR for delivery during the fourth year of the agreement, which ends this September 30, now total 2.25 mln tonnes.

"TAIWAN FURTHER RELAXES FOREIGN GOODS IMPORT CURBS. Taiwan said it would soon relax import controls on some 400 foreign items, including stationery and books, in a further effort to allow trading partners, especially the U.S., Greater access to its markets. Taiwan announced the easing of import curbs on some 600 farm and industrial products last month, a Council for Economic Planning and Development spokesman told Reuters. He said the new move was intended to balance trade between Taiwan and its trading partners. The island's trade surplus reached a record 15.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year, up from 10.62 billion in 1985. In January, Taiwan cut import tariffs on some 1,700 foreign products and allowed imports of U.S. Wine, beer and cigarettes. ""We hope the measures will help reduce our trade surplus this year, especially with that of the U.S.,"" the spokesman said. Washington is pressing Taiwan to open its markets wider as a way of cutting its trade deficit with the island, which rose to 2.35 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 1.87 billion in the year-earlier period.

"BALLY <BLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT. Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit, analysts said. ""In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesses,"" said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit, which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs. Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said ""the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the offering goes."" Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2 mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs. Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it. ""It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating income, making it an attractive buy to a third party,"" Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said. On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8 mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share. About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson. Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally spokesperson said. Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long range prospects. ""The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle,"" said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes. In addition, ""the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry,"" said one analyst. There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding clubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry. Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the nation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, ""no one has the money to offer to buy it."" ""The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization,"" said Wayne LaChapelle, chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation's second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but ""could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time.""

"USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT. Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes in the week ended March 19 were the highest level since mid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said. Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and 170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said. Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and 125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third from the preceding week and the four-week average. Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from 1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted. Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior week and two-thirds above the four-week average. Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main buyers, the department said. Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser. Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama, the department said. Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season -- were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the four-week average. Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major buyers for the current season, while Thailand, Britain and Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the department said.

Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.

Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market. Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from 6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.

"TIN PACT EXTENSION LIKELY - ITC DELEGATES. An extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement, ITA, for one or two years beyond June 30 is increasingly likely, International Tin Council, ITC, delegates said following a special council session today. A formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council session on April 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget and activities for the year beginning July one, they stated. Delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal ITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact. The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, against the January court ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC creditor brokers to have the ITC wound up. In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the tin council, the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the U.K. Companies act, and the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in respect of an arbitration award. AMT is appealing on all points and has said it is important for the court to accept that a winding-up petition is a move to enforce an arbitration ruling.

"NEW GASOLINE GRADE TO RAISE U.S. REFINING COSTS.

Phillips Petroleum <P> expects to begin marketing the new 89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.

"EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY. The maximum rebate granted at yesterday's European Community (EC) sugar tender marked no change in policy towards producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the EC, EC commission sources said. They said this was despite the fact that the commission accepted over 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set too low. The maximum rebate at yesterday's tender was 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos, up from 45.678 Ecus the previous week. London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest ever granted. The commission sources said today the increase was entirely explained by world market conditions. The amount by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention remained at 0.87 Ecus per 100 kilos, they said. Operators offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said were too low. The sources said about 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted, the remainder being rejected as of too low quality. The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and payment for it. They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet, adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or two to review commission policy before making up their minds. The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable in the light of its 1987/88 farm price package proposal to reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of the new season in July.

"NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE WITH U.S.. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said. At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors. Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors. Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action. Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output. In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets. In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

"TALKS FAIL TO END BRAZILIAN SEAMEN'S STRIKE. Pay talks aimed at ending a week-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and the strike will continue, a union official said. The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters. The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma). Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute. He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa. Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to the government, which has suspended interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. ""Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment and it is not conceivable that exports be hit,"" he told the Gazeta Mercantil newspaper.

The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said.

Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying.

The paper quoted U.S. Intelligence sources as saying the missiles appeared to be of a Chinese design known as HY-2 which is based on the Soviet SSN2 or Styx missile. Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles. It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz. Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only with a lucky hit, the paper said. None of the new missiles had been fired yet, it added. The CBS television network reported on Friday that Iran had installed new missiles along the Gulf and said Washington had warned Tehran not to use them against civilian shipping.

"SMITHKLINE <SKB> AIMS FOR 10 PCT EARNINGS RAISE. SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder of the decade. In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs. The company said in its annual report that its nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than its pharmaceutical business. SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings from existing products, expand its product portfolio and optimize its financial resources. To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered by two joint ventures, one with <Wellcome PLC>, and one pending venture in Japan. SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct annually. ""Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility,"" Gavin Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln dlrs. It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen activator, over the next two years. It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel. Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in testing for the AIDS antibody. Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares. SmithKline begins the year with a new management team, including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

"INDIA'S CREDIT POLICY AIMS TO CONTROL LIQUIDITY. India's credit policy package for fiscal 1987/88 (April-March) will help ease inflationary pressures and control the growth of overall liqudity, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement. The package, announced earlier this week, will raise commercial bank statutory liquidity ratios to 37.5 pct from 37 pct, effective April 25, and will increase cash reserve ratios on foreign currency (non-resident) accounts to 9.5 pct from three pct, effective May 23, it said. Excess liquidity pushed wholesale and consumer retail prices higher in 1986/87 on previous year levels, RBI governor R. N. Malhotra said in a statement. Malhotra said India's M-3 money supply grew 209.24 billion rupees in the fiscal year to March 13, compared to a growth of 155.38 billion in the same period the year before. Commercial bank aggregate deposits rose to 164.10 billion in the same period, against 120.66 billion in the corresponding months of fiscal 1986/87, he said. The Finance Ministry in a report issued in February predicted India's fiscal 1986/87 wholesale price-linked inflation rate at about 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.

Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner. It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years. The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over by state-owned banks. Official sources said Toyota's application was likely to be approved.

"CONFIDENCE IN OPEC FIRMS U.S. ENERGY FUTURES. Renewed confidence in OPEC's ability to limit production helped U.S. energy futures settle above yesterday's closing prices, according to analysts. They also said the heating oil contract found additional support from a short-covering rally on the close. April crude closed 24 cts higher to 17.75 dlrs. April heating oil was 1.47 cts higher to 47.91 cts a gallon. ""Most traders expected follow through profit-taking from yesterday but the market found suport from bullish reports that OPEC is producing within its quota,"" said Simon Greenshields, a vice president with Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. News today, including OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman statement that OPEC February production did not exceed its official quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day, helped bouy prices, traders said. A Reuter survey found OPEC production in early March was 14.7 mln bpd. In addition to short-covering, heating oil found support from traders buying it against sales of gasoline and crude, as well as from expectations for continued drawdowns in stocks as refiners shut down for maintenance, traders said. Unleaded gasoline for April finished 0.55 cent higher to 51.24 cts a gallon.

"CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR. Cuban sugar export figures for January suggest that this year's crop may be at least as large as last year's 7.35 mln tonnes, according to sugar analysts. Exports in January totalled 733,000 tonnes raw value, up from 725,000 a year earlier, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization. January is the first major export month and the figures thus give a good indication of the current crop, they said. Fourth quarter exports fell to 622,000 tonnes from 909,000 tonnes a year earlier, but this was because Cuba was destocking at the end of 1985, they added. Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this year at 7.50 mln tonnes. Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was 12,000 tonnes, giving a final 1985/86 crop total of 7.35 mln tonnes, compared with a 1984/85 crop of 8.10 mln tonnes. There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba, but a hurricane meant that last year's crop was extended. Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at 362,000 tonnes from 489,000 in January 1986, but other Comecon countries received 210,000 tonnes, against 80,000 tonnes in the same month last year, figures received by the ISO show. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania all took substantially more Cuban sugar. Cuba's November 1986 exports totalled 158,000 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985, and December's total was 237,000 tonnes, down from 518,000 tonnes the year before. Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 6.69 mln tonnes against 7.21 mln in 1985 -- the lowest level since 1980's 6.19 mln tonnes, the figures show.

"BEGHIN-SAY NOT PLANNING TO WITHDRAW SUGAR. French sugar producer Beghin-Say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention, despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week's European Community (EC) sugar tender, Beghin-Say President Jean-Marc Vernes told Reuters. The maximum rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos on Wednesday was the largest ever granted, according to traders. Vernes said he was satisfied the European Commission has started to move in the right direction, but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention. But Vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention. European operators offered 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low. Over 785,000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on Wednesday, according to commission sources. Under EC regulations, however, operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it. A total of 706,470 tonnes of French sugar and 79,000 tonnes of West German sugar has been accepted into intervention, trade sources said here. This amount represents about a third of annual EC exports to non-EC countries. Beghin-Say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention, but said it was below 500,000 tonnes. Producers say they have been losing 2.5 to 3.0 Ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between EC and world prices. Wednesday's rebate was 0.87 Ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention, traders said. Vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which equates to the full intervention price and said Wednesday's tender was a step in the right direction. Sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the begining of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate. Trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates, which are due to be adopted shortly, may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future. One source at a leading French sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards adapting the situation accordingly, thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got satisfaction.

"LEIGH-PEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES. The Bank of England does not favour the introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said. Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested,"" he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said. Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."" They ""should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the whirlwind to visit elsewhere,"" he added.

"ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement. A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week. ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget."" Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat. Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy. As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment"" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct. The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped. Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow. ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future. The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said. Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern. ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"" he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation. The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation. Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the ""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front. He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness. Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts. Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg. But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988. Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately. But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it. James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost."" Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory. Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. ""They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil,"" one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.

"ENERGY/U.S. REFINING. U.S. refiners said they are worried that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when the industry is recovering from a recent slump. ""We have to look at national security and cut the amount of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the industry,"" said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD). U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S. consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid 1990s, according to the Department of Energy. ""Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil requirements 15 or so years from now?"" asked John Swearingen, chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp <CIL> and former chief executive of Amoco Corp <AN>. ""If your answer to that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that we can now to cope with this situation and improve our position."" But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas. ""Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging because those things won't solve our problems and could well compound them,"" said Swearingen. ""Once the government affects values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going to be subverted by government,"" he added. William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged. Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is controversal but might work, said Dunham. Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and product imports. ""Why would companies import crude when they could import products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"" asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum <CNP>. An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham said. ""The energy security issue should be considered when environmental issues are considered,"" Martin said. ""The level of investment for the proposed lowering of sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is unacceptable,"" Dunham said. ""Most companies cannot afford it."" George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these proposals ""will place pressure on small refining operations and promote further industry consolidation."" An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs. The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986 for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the average aromatics content was 32 pct. Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which is beginning to be marketed by some companies. ""What will be the standard octane level in various grades of unleaded gasoline?"" asked Dunham. ""A midlevel grade of unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an investment has to be made,"" Dunham said. This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg. Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to move higher in the next few months. ""We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"" said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA>. Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S. stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said. ""This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,"" Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily a gasoline producer.

"FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR. The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said. The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment. The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said. Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said. It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp <GM>. GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit <General Motors-Holden's Ltd>, it said. However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said. Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier. Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier.

"U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN. A meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European Community, U.S. trade officials said. Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure on EC member states. ""We (all agencies) are together on this,"" said one U.S. trade official. One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax ""there will be a great cost."" U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up. ""I don't think we're at that point yet,"" said one trade official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package. Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said ""sometimes its better not to be specific."" U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax.

"POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES. Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said. The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted. ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists. But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday. Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses. ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico. Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals. Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week. The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook. With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices. Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook. Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday. ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer. The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely ""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at tremendously high levels."" Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

"JAPAN SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PARIS CURRENCY ACCORD. Japan will seek to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow, Japanese officials said. However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified, would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord, which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February, to be strengthened. Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow, the Japanese officials said. The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said. Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates, officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion. The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention. The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also for the benefit of the United States as well. As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7, the officials said. However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which started April one, the officials said. Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending.

"GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS. Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris. Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief. An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned. The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks. Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax. An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies. The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule. The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain. The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below. Stoltenberg said: ""We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment.""

"BRAZIL TO BUY 30,000 BPD OF KUWAITI OIL. Brazil will import 30,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Kuwait, a spokesman for the state oil company Petrobras said. He said that, unlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait did not impose any conditions on Brazil. Last month, Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis eventually lifted the condition and Brazil decided to reconfirm the purchase. Brazil currently consumes 1.1 mln barrels of oil per day.

"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP. Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said. They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops. The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting. Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production. The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production. The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week. The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86. The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season. Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

"JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR. Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future. Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year.

"ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. Ultramar Plc <UMAR.L> said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results. Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories. But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery. The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985. The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets. Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation. The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term. Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery. In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base. Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis. Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night's close.

"HUGHES <HT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER <BKO>. An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker International Corp based on revised terms that allow the companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as required by the U.S. Justice Department. Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold. An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit. The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business. Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger. Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period. Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month extension to complete the sale. He said there were ""several people looking"" at the domestic drilling bit business. The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore. Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects ""substantial cutbacks"" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc, the name the merged company will take. Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course. ""We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven,"" he said. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs. Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost 34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

"COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELP RETURN TO PROFITS. Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.

"NO NEAR TERM BRAZIL COFFEE MOVES EXPECTED. The Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said. IBC president Jorio Dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess Brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in London earlier this month to set new International Coffee Organization, ICO, export quotas. ""The failure of the talks means Brazil has got to rethink its position completely,"" one Santos exporter said. A meeting of the National Coffee Policy Council is set for Thursday, March 19, and Dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures. Dauster told reporters on his return from London last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry. Exporters said Dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. World prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO talks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year. The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of May and June export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set. With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world markets, they said. They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, April registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day. If May/June registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month. ""The problem would be how to limit sales,"" one exporter said. Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings. However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war. General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO. The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were reintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks. With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added. However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets. Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance at the ICO talks, they added.

"U.K. VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY. Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said. The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January. Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January. Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January. Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected. The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures. The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5. The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln. The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import volume seems to have stablised. The Departnment said exports to the U.S. May be benefiting from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates.

"CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS. One or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said. As a result, call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds. Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month. Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion. To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market. Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said. Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so. With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return. One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday. Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said. ""(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount,"" he said. ""If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."" But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets. International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar. ""The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,"" the senior dealer said. Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism. Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany's major employers and the unions, the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said. Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.

""In recent years Brazil has demonstrated its ability to generate surpluses sufficient to service its debt, and I have no doubt that, in due course, it will reach an agreement with the banks and its other creditors,"" Libra managing director Peter Belmont said in a statement.

Libra's net worth increased by 24 pct to 134 mln stg last year, and Belmont said the improvement to the bank's balance sheet was due to profits being mostly retained in the bank, and to the issue of 10 mln stg of cumulative redeemable preference shares during the year.

Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations.

"U.K. AND GERMANY LEAD ATTACK ON EC FARM REFORMS. Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said. West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added. They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis. Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports. Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said. Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations. The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body GATT. But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added. Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S. Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added.

"TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST. Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.

"OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL. OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: ""OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs."" But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. ""For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production,"" Al-Wattari said. ""Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,"" Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. ""A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation,"" he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. ""The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation,"" he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.

"GEODOME SETS IDAHO GOLD/SILVER MINE CONSTRUCTION. Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's Stearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible. The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs. It said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life. Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome. Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price. Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years, in constant dollars.

"GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST. The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year. The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn. The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year. The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1.5 pct. Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct. In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak. DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods, not between foreign and domestic demand. It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans. Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand, it said. In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall markedly this year. However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986, it said.

"S.AFRICA'S FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER. The financial rand, widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank economists said. The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6, they added. It has risen about two cents this week alone. ""Another factor is that banks in London, where the main market is based, are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future,"" one economist said. Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains. After reaching 30 cents, ""There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks,"" one dealer said. There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were staying firm, banking sources said. A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said: ""The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas."" One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand's rise. Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa's long-term government bonds and ""semi-gilts"" or securities in partly government-owned firms, many with yields as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands. ""This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand,"" a dealer said, adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply. The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country.

"U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION. A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies. The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment. The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980. A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos. But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration. ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. ""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,"" he said. The oil companies, Amoco Corp <AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses. The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs. Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources. The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.

"ROSTENKOWSKI OPPOSES PROTECTIONIST TRADE BILL. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year. In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year. But he warned that his ""conciliatory message"" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods. ""Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"" Rostenkowski said. ""It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market,"" he added. However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

"TEXACO <TX> RESERVES DOWN DESPITE LOWER OUTPUT. Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its annual report said. The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of the judgement won by Pennzoil Co <PZL> against Texaco on charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire Getty Oil Co. The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in this case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having to seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the federal bankruptcy code. Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs, Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than March 30. Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier. However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of 1985. Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln, respectively. Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from 1.55 billion. The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000 barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day -- representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986. Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at the end of 1985.

"ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE. British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down,"" he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. ""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets. But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

"BALDRIGE WARNS OF WORLD TRADE WAR DANGER. U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war. ""The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I've ever seen it in six years in Washington,"" Baldrige said in a television interview. ""I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration, but there is a hardening trade attitude,"" he said. President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation, but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation. However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalise trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. Could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill. When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war, Baldrige said: ""Yes, I don't think there's any question about that.""

"BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED, SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS. BAT Industries Plc <BTI.L> 1986 results, which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the company was in a strong position and that its shares were probably undervalued, share analysts said. BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39 billion pre-tax. Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the share price. ""In the current market, people almost expect companies to beat expectations,"" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast. BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985 pretax profit of 1.17 billion. Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs. BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74 pct four years ago. Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company declining further as other sectors increased in importance. He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial services, in particular in the U.S. Sheehy also said the group had ""no sizeable acquisitions"" in sight in the near future. Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the U.K. Insurance area was encouraging. Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16 pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make major acquisitions, they said.

"JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED. Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said. As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise. The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year. The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation."" Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture. On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,"" he said. ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said. Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."" And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem. ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock. ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures. ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.

"U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. ""As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year,"" he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. ""But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate,"" the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 ""is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular."" On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said ""it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position."" Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. ""We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead,"" Lawson said. ""Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy."" ""But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future."" Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the ""appropriate corporation tax rate."" He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. ""Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89,"" Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, ""with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due."" ""I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File."" This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but ""genuine trading companies"" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. ""In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,"" he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added ""given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget."" Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. ""The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,"" Lawson said.

"BLACK MINERS SUPPORT S. AFRICAN MINES TAKEOVER. Thousands of black mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers.

They also supported a proposal for a national strike at the end of this month if the owners refused to begin negotiations. Migrant workers from surrounding countries make up more than half of the labour force in the mines. It was not stated how the union would ""seize control."" The miners' leaders also demanded an end to the system of single sex hostels for migrant workers, to be replaced by housing schemes so that workers could live with their families.

"RESORTS INT'L <RT.A> RECEIVES TAKEOVER OFFER. Resorts International Inc said it received a proposal from <KSZ Co Inc> under which holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be formed through the takeover. Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of common stock in the new company. Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware corporation. Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220 mln dlrs of equity. It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of special preferred stock. The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a commitment from <M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special preferred stock. Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27. It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co, to advise its board on the offer. Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the 752,297 class B shares outstanding. Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining class B shares outstanding. Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting power of the class B shares. Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made by Pratt Hotel Corp <PRAT>. Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire Resorts. Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the special preferred stock would immediately be converted into exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.

A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said. The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman. Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was not immediately available for comment.

"BANK OF ENGLAND OFFERS EARLY HELP IN MONEY MARKET. The Bank of England said it had invited the discount houses to make an early round of bill offers to help offset a large liquidity shortage in the money market. It estimated the shortage at around 1.55 billion stg, one adverse factor being the unwinding of a sale and repurchase agreement, with the market having to buy back bills worth 542 mln stg from the Bank. Bills maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would drain 957 mln stg wile exchequer transactions and a note circulation rise would take out 15 mln and 25 mln respectively. Above target bankers' balances would add 10 mln.

"SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA. Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year. The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said. Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan. But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said.

"ENDOTRONICS <ENDO> EXPECTS LOSS FOR YEAR. Endotronics Inc said it expects to incur ""substantial losses"" for the second quarter ending March 31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987. As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <Yamaha Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note. In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year. Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp <CZ>. The company said its ability to obtain funding was adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against three officers of Endotronics. Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges violations of the federal securities laws in connection with statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports. The company also said the Securities Division of the Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by insiders and brokers in the company's common shares. It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said. As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the various investigations concerning insider trading, the company said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the United States.

"JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES. Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an ""umbrella"" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said.

"IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD. OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said. A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report. These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period. It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd FOURTH QTR 1986 JANUARY 1987 FEBRUARY 1987 SAUDI ARABIA 4.9 3.7 3.8 IRAN 1.6 2.2 1.9 IRAQ 1.6 1.6 1.7 UAE 1.3 1.2 1.2 KUWAIT 1.0 1.0 1.0 NEUTRAL ZONE 0.5 0.4 0.4 QATAR 0.3 0.3 0.2 NIGERIA 1.3 1.2 1.2 LIBYA 1.0 1.0 1.0 FOURTH QTR 1986 JANUARY 1987 FEBRUARY 1987 ALGERIA 0.6 0.6 0.6 GABON 0.1 0.2 0.2 VENEZUELA 1.6 1.6 1.6 ECUADOR 0.2 0.2 0.2 INDONESIA 1.3 1.2 1.2 TOTAL 17.3 16.5 16.1 The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains. Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

"UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986. Unilever Plc <UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said. He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years. Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted. But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place ""from time to time,"" he said. The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion. Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc <CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution. However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs. Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987. The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit. Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process. He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities. In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase. However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.

"COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE. The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. ""If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices,"" a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the ""must-buy"" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. ""We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,"" Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, ""Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers."" Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.

"HARPER <HPR> GETS BID FROM HARCOURT <HBJ>. Harper and Row Publishers Inc said it received an acquisition offer from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich INc to acquire all of Harper and Row's shares at 50 dlrs a share in cash. Harper said it will consider the proposal, including such possible concerns as anti-trust and other legal considerations. On Monday, Harper and Row received a surprise 34 dlr-a- share bid from investor Theodore Cross, owner of six pct of the shares, for the stock he does not own. Harcourt made clear in its offer that it will step aside if Harper's directors and shareholders reject the bid, Harper said. Harper said the board has previously expressed a strong determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise. Harper also said that New World Pictures, a shareholder, has requested a copy of Harper's shareholder list to be used in soliciting proxies. New World has 30,800 shares of the total 4.4 mln shares. Harper and Row's stock closed off 3/4 to 33-1/2 after rising 9-1/4 points yesterday. Shareholders are due to vote April 2 on a shareholders rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers. Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with the investment banking for of Sterling Grace and Co said Harper and Row is one of the few remaining independent publishers with a ""back list"" of authors stretching back 200 years. He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with the estates of deceased authors, it controls all motion picture and television rights to the stories. And he said new printing technologies make new editions a profitable business. ""Harcourt Brace needs a back list of that nature and is willing to pay up for it,"" Obolensky said. But he said Harper and Row ""has plenty of beef to warrant a 50 dlr bid.

"COFFEE FUTURES AT SIX-YEAR LOW, UNDER 1 DLR/LB. Coffee futures dipped further today and closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years. Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the lowest price since August, 1981. Prices have been falling steadily since the International Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed this week as the executive board of the organization met in London without reopening debate on its export quotas. The executive board has limited its current discussions to administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday. Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30 dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down. Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high point for the year because most producing nations have just completed their harvests. In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital. ""This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to undertake sales despite the drop in prices,"" she said. Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said.

"U.S. SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE. The U.S. Expects more harmonious talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade. ""The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters. ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect, more harmonious than usual."" Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States. During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S. Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a circuitous route. That angered Washington. The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said. More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community threatened to become a trade war. In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute. Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad, supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad. A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets."" Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the Community's common agricultural policy (CAP). To Washington, as one official put it, ""CAP is the root of all evil"" in international food trade because it subsidises farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

"EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED. European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called ""C"" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC ""A"" and ""B"" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic ""A"" and ""B"" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. ""The basic trend is towards stability,"" a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has ""A"" and ""B"" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its ""C"" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of ""C"" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined ""A"" and ""B"" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. ""The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of ""C"" sugar really worthwhile,"" the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.

"CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES. The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers. ""They're all lower,"" he said. ""This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."" Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts. But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

"FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT. The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today. ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush trader said. ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

"SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about conditions on Wall Street. ""Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey,"" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities. ""Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"" Markey said. ""The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing."" Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high fines and disbarment from the securities industry. ""Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders,"" Shad said in his statement. Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years. Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts. N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC. ""Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy of existing surveillance systems and government oversight operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,"" Rinaldo said.

"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL. The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

"JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said. The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1. The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus. MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export. Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request, they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter. If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year. MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback. One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up. MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.

"BALDRIGE SAYS U.S. TO IMPOSE JAPANESE SANCTIONS. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlr sanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports, despite any U.S. Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs. He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was sure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade, but ""I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out."" Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17. He also said he did not think there would be a trade war with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the United States to risk such a war. ""Those fears are unfounded,"" he said. He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact. Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some effect. Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop in the market to trade sanctions were ""barking up the wrong tree."" He said the market observers will realize this shortly. Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar.

"NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88. New Zealand's inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said. The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December. Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter. The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87. The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to change, it said. Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in calendar 1986, it said. ""Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls away,"" the NZIER said. Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct. Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct. The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4. ""A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast,"" the NZIER said. ""The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in 1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88."" The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32 billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and 3.33 billion in 1985/86. The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87 billion in 1985/86. This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion. ""Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation ...,"" the NZIER said. ""Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well for future prospects.""

Government outlays include mainly deficiency payments and price support loans. On a per acre basis, cotton payments will reach 73.24 dlrs in 1987, wheat 60.30 dlrs, sorghum 54.38 dlrs, barley 27.41 dlrs and oats 2.31 dlrs, USDA said.

Royal Bank said it set its provisions ""given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices,"" and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their potential impact on the Royal Bank.

"RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS. The chairman of the conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week. The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20. Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October. Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, ""I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned."" ""It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed."" He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers. The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations. Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms. The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices. Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation. Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic ""that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled."" Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile. Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, ""There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement.""

"GUINNESS STARTS COURT ACTION AGAINST SAUNDERS. Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> said it has started court proceedings against former chairman and chief executive Ernest Saunders and non-executive director Thomas Ward for recovery of 5.2 mln stg. The money was paid to Ward via Marketing and Acquisition Consultants Ltd in Jersey. Guinness said earlier it would propose a resolution at the annual meeting in May to remove Saunders and Ward as directors of the company. Earlier this month, lawyers for Ward told a Jersey court that Ward saw the payment as his reward for services in last year's takeover battle for <Distillers Co Plc>. Guinness has said that both men breached their fiduciary duty in authorising the payment. Saunders resigned from his executive positions at Guinness in January in the aftermath of a government enquiry into share dealings during the battle for Distillers but retained his position on the board.

"VARITY<VAT> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR. Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully integrated. However, operating results are likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said. Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier profit of 3.9 mln dlrs. Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss. Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's depressed levels, the company said. However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said. The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said.

"GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS. The Bundesbank's options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said. Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""I don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country's most powerful union, the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. ""The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

"NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA. Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower ""marginal"" rate, analysts said. ""It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,"" a Western diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. ""They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend,"" the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. ""So far so good"" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira's black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September.

"FRENCH 1986/87 SOFT WHEAT EXPORTS FALL. Exports of French soft wheat for the period July 1, 1986, to March 1, 1987, fell 27.6 pct to 8.21 mln tonnes from 11.34 mln tonnes in the same 1985/86 period, the national cereals office ONIC said quoting customs figures. Of this total, exports to non-EC countries totalled 3.76 mln tonnes, 34 pct down on 5.70 mln, and exports to EC nations 4.45 mln tonnes, 21.1 pct down on a previous 5.64 mln.

"BANK OF FRANCE CUTS INTERVENTION RATE. The Bank of France said it cut its money market intervention rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct when it injected money against first category paper. The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2 pct from 8-3/4 pct. The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11. The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills maturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989. The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a money market intervention tender earlier today. Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.

"NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND. Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said. The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo. The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said. Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added. The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing. Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said. The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm. The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments. Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co. Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said. To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,"" Smithson said.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual meeting, the company said. Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of silver to Placer, Equity said. Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000 ounce minimum commitment for 1987. Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to Placer. Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said. It also said the stock and silver transactions will create a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when cash is available. The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the company said. It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might be paid. The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver said. Equity Silver had retained earnings of 2,312,000 dlrs at December 31, 1986.

"MAJOR U.S. BANKS MOVE TO HIGHER 7-3/4 PCT PRIME. Most major U.S. banks today matched Tuesday's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, the first prime rate boosts since mid-1984. Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and funding costs as justification. Analysts said the prime rate rises may have been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhance profit margins given problems with developing country loans. Commenting on the prime rate increases, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committee that ""I hope it was a temporary blip upward."" Among the major banks which today announced prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank, Continental Illinois National Bank, Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Irving Trust, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, Marine Midland, and Security Pacific National Bank.

"U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS. Leading U.S. farm state senators are seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP, to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including the Soviet Union, Senate staff said. Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading practices. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies, sources said. The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor (D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) -- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from Canadian imports. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), would clarify the definition of ""industry"" in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers. Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U.S. producers. The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.

"ALLIED-LYONS SEES NO CHANGE IN HIRAM WALKER STAKE. Allied-Lyons PLC <ALLD.L> and Canada's Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said. Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns' <Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of <Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>. ""We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope there won't be any change, but there could be,"" Holden-Brown told reporters after a speech in Toronto. He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct. ""Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion for either the put or call to be exercised,"" Holden-Brown said. In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49 pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. ""I don't think we would have any objection to it,"" he added. Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's board of directors and has total responsibility for its management. ""We cannot contemplate giving up our control,"" he said. Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial results, but he said ""it will be substantial."" ""I am not able to give profit forecasts,"" he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings, and has no current plans for a stock issue. He said the company is not currently negotiating any more acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food concerns. ""I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery scene (which is) highly concentrated already,"" he added. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

"U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING. A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said. ""Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,"" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week. The ""mini-refunding,"" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs. The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar. Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities. But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit. ""Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,"" they said in a weekly report. Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's sales. ""The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,"" he said in a weekly market review. But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run. ""Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,"" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year on April 1. And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence. Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said. Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said. This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January's depressed levels. Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct. Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined. Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date. Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday. Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level.

"ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA. Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said. The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used. ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months. During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said. Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he added. Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa. Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1, ""My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines."" According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train. ""The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,"" one western diplomat said. ""A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage,"" he added.

"WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT. Unfavorable late winter weather conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop, the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said. The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather. He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather. Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said. The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say. The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said. However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery.

"JAPAN'S JOBLESS SEEN RISING TO 3.3 PCT IN 1987/88. The yen's rise against the dollar is expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3 pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said. The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct. The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year. Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment. Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical machinery sectors, Nomura said.

"SOVIET FIRM SAYS TALKS ON FOR PHILIPPINE MINE. Preliminary talks are on between two state-owned Philippine banks and Soviet metal trading and equipment sales company Tsvetmetpromexport on rescuing Nonoc Mining and Industrial Corp (NMIC) which operates the Philippines' only nickel refinery, a Soviet official said. G.I. Valentchits, Deputy Trade Minister at the Soviet embassy, told Reuters a report earlier this week that Tsvetmetpromexport had asked the Philippine government whether it could help rehabilitate or operate NMIC was incorrect. ""It is the other way round,"" Valentchits said. He said the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which own NMIC, had approached the Soviet state-owned firm in August last year. ""We studied the question and asked the banks in which field and what area they can help in the project,"" Valentchits said. He said there had been no reply yet from NMIC and the talks were ""only just initial."" NMIC President Arthur Aguilar and other company officials were not available for comment. Manila banking sources said the situation was serious at NMIC, set up by DBP and PNB in August 1984 after the two banks foreclosed on the assets of Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corp over a 17 billion peso obligation. The bankers said NMIC itself has recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for placing the company under receivership and the suspension of its debt payments in order to protect it from threats of foreclosure. Business Day newspaper said the latest credits extended to NMIC include a 127 mln dlr loan, with Chemical Bank as the lead agent. The newspaper said another 33 mln dlr loan was lead managed by Citicorp. It said the government's privatisation program has listed NMIC at a price of at least 700 mln dlrs, adding that foreign investors were wary of taking over the ailing nickel firm. The bankers said NMIC was currently burdened with debts of at least 15.8 billion pesos and is facing 10 civil lawsuits for foreclosures from major creditors. The Business Bulletin newspaper said the firm had assets totalling 12.2 billion pesos, while DBP and PNB exposures with the firm were estimated at 14.9 billion pesos. NMIC has not operated its plant in the southern Philippines since March 1986 after workers struck demanding payment of salaries delayed because of the firm's financial difficulties. The firm produced 1,863 tonnes of nickel in the first two months of 1986, compared with 2,364 tonnes in the same period in 1985. The mine's capacity is 2,000 tonnes a month.

"U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH. Surprisingly strong U.S. housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth, economists said. Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom. U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804 mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986. The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764 mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January. ""February's weather is usually more adverse for home building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures inflate the statistics. Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month. But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer. ""Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'Let's do it now',"" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much of the financing for home building. But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy. He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct. As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1. Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317 mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate. ""Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers to start waving ""four pct GNP banners"" for the first quarter. Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter. But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not convinced that growth will pick up in future. ""The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on now, not all of which is intentional,"" he said. For example, U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks, produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln. Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second, he said. ""If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"" agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed. ""At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the second,"" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - MITSUBISHI HEAVY FIGHTS BACK. International efforts to redirect Japan's export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> (MHI), which began making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130 years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets. ""If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products, everyone will buy them,"" MHI president Yotaro Iida said. Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40 pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview. Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year. ""We have made the utmost efforts among the world's manufacturers to improve productivity,"" he said. ""You may be surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers."" Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in 1976. Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion. And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen. Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct. MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years ago. China is the most promising market, although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers. ""Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency,"" Iida said. But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support. It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future. In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport. Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity. Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects, including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites. It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms. MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s. Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S. ""It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,"" Iida said. MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage, he said. The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support. In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct. As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to specify which products. ""By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on your daily products, although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business,"" he said.

The company, which lowered the payout from 27 cts to 26 cts this current quarter, said it did not know how low the payout would go.

A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a scandal at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses ""has nothing to do"" with the timing of the VEBA sale. Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair. A banker involved in the VEBA placement said ""Nothing has changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take place in the second half of March."" This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its preparatory work, although the price had not been decided. The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

"INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL, FEARS MAY SHORTAGE. Indonesia has issued licences to traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May, Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters. ""We have given permission for a small amount of imports to prevent a shortage during Ramadan,"" he said. He gave no figures for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would come from Malaysia. Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer, earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences. Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April. Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and have large meals after sunset. Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of 1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures, against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985. Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan.

Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct. Total West German consumption was estimated at around a high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985. South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 - 182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes. The two South American countries' share of the West German market rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from Ecuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985. West Germany imported 56,823 tonnes of fishmeal in December, up from 46,236 tonnes in the same 1985 month, with re-exports at 22,262 tonnes after 25,062 a year earlier.

"COMBUSTION ENGINEERING<CSP> SEES 1ST QTR NET OFF. Combustion Engineering Inc said it expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the year-ago 13.6 mln dlrs, mainly due to financing costs resulting from the January 1987 acquisition of AccuRay Corp. The company said it has filed for an offering of four mln common shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 2017, with proceeds to be used to refinance the short-term bank debt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance other costs of the transaction and for general corporate purposes. Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S. and the remainder overseas. Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker of computer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp and paper mills. The company said it expects to release first quarter results in the third week in April. Combustion said it expects further restructuring of core businesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year through staff reductions downsizings and the consolidation of facilities. Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year losses in the Engineering and Construction segment. But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be approximately offset by a number of factors, including a somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation segment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay technology and operations and delays in waste to energy projects.

"ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN. President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments. Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt. ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."" Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said. He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

"GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY. Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has ""significantly deteriorated"" and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana. In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs. ""The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,"" Gulf States said. The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana. ""If the regulatory commissions approve the company's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"" Gulf States said. In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas. Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief. In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

However, the status of TWA's bid for USAir Group is currently uncertain. The U.S. Transportation Department has rejected TWA's application to acquire USAir on deficiency grounds, but TWA has said it will file a revised application, Moody's noted. Under Moody's review for possible downgrade are USAir Group's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2 subordinated debentures, along with the USAir unit's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1 subordinated debentures. Moody's said it would examine the effects of the proposed mergers on USAir Group's financial measurements, as well as potential damage to the company's financial flexibility because of the probability of increased debt-service requirements.
