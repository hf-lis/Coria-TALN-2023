optimization, machine learning and more. We present ""All Vertex Triangle

$\overline S$ of all $K$ vertices of $conv(S)$, the convex hull of $S$. If
$\Gamma_*$ is the minimum of the distances from each vertex to the convex hull
of the remaining vertices, given any $\gamma \leq \gamma_* = \Gamma_*/R$, $R$
the diameter of $S$, $AVTA$ computes $\overline S$ in $O(nK(m+ \gamma^{-2}))$
operations. If $\gamma_*$ is unknown but $K$ is known, AVTA computes $\overline
S$ in $O(nK(m+ \gamma_*^{-2})) \log(\gamma_*^{-1})$ operations. More generally,
given $t \in (0,1)$, AVTA computes a subset $\overline S^t$ of $\overline S$ in
$O(n |\overline S^t|(m+ t^{-2}))$ operations, where the distance between any $p
\in conv(S)$ to $conv(\overline S^t)$ is at most $t R$. Next we consider AVTA

a bound on $\varepsilon$ in terms of the minimum of the distances of vertices

models AVTA leads to significantly better reconstruction of the topic-word

whether any consistent ranking exists is coNP-hard (but in Delta_2^p) if the

sizes and coding delay are all reduced by a factor O(n) at a redundancy below
2*log(e)/2^g bits/symbol (for n input symbols and g-bit QI precision). Due to
its tighter enumeration, QI output redundancy is below that of arithmetic
coding (which can be derived as a lower accuracy approximation of QI). The
relative compression gain vanishes in large n and in high entropy limits and
increases for shorter outputs and for less predictable data. QI is
significantly faster than the fastest arithmetic coders, from factor 6 in high
entropy limit to over 100 in low entropy limit (`typically' 10-20 times
faster). These speedups are result of using only 3 adds, 1 shift and 2 array
lookups (all in 32 bit precision) per less probable symbol and no coding
operations for the most probable symbol . Further, the exact enumeration

  Using Displacement Likelihood And Evidence From Geochemical Assays","This paper presents a Bayesian framework for manipulating mesh surfaces with
the aim of improving the positional integrity of the geological boundaries that

initially using sparse data, capture the global trend and provide a reasonable
approximation of the stratigraphic, mineralisation and other types of
boundaries for mining exploration, but they are locally inaccurate at scales
typically required for grade estimation. The proposed methodology makes local
spatial corrections automatically to maximise the agreement between the
modelled surfaces and observed samples. Where possible, vertices on a mesh
surface are moved to provide a clear delineation, for instance, between ore and
waste material across the boundary based on spatial and compositional analysis;
using assay measurements collected from densely spaced, geo-registered blast
holes. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution ultimately considers the
chemistry observation likelihood in a given domain. Furthermore, it is guided

specifying and reasoning about structure by means of patterns and pattern
matching. Its sentences, the patterns, are constructed using variables,
symbols, connectives and quantifiers, but no difference is made between
function and predicate symbols. In models, a pattern evaluates into a power-set
domain (the set of values that match it), in contrast to FOL where functions
and predicates map into a regular domain. Matching logic uniformly generalizes
several logical frameworks important for program analysis, such as:
propositional logic, algebraic specification, FOL with equality, modal logic,
and separation logic. Patterns can specify separation requirements at any level
in any program configuration, not only in the heaps or stores, without any
special logical constructs for that: the very nature of pattern matching is
that if two structures are matched as part of a pattern, then they can only be
spatially separated. Like FOL, matching logic can also be translated into pure
predicate logic with equality, at the same time admitting its own sound and
complete proof system. A practical aspect of matching logic is that FOL
reasoning with equality remains sound, so off-the-shelf provers and SMT solvers
can be used for matching logic reasoning. Matching logic is particularly

for secure group messaging. By secure we mean for the actual users i.e.
end-to-end security, as opposed to ""secure"" for irrelevant third parties.
  Our work provides everything needed to run a messaging session between real
users on top of a real transport protocol. That is, we specify not just a key
exchange, but when and how to run these relative to transport-layer events; how
to achieve liveness properties such as reliability and consistency, that are
time-sensitive and lie outside of the send-receive logic that cryptography-only
protocols often restrict themselves to; and offer suggestions for displaying
accurate (i.e. secure) but not overwhelming information in user interfaces.
  We aim towards a general-purpose unified protocol. In other words, we'd
prefer to avoid creating a completely new protocol merely to support
automation, or asynchronity, or a different transport protocol. This would add
complexity to the overall ecosystem of communications protocols. It is simply
unnecessary if the original protocol is designed well, as we have tried to do.
  That aim is not complete -- our full protocol system, as currently
implemented, is suitable only for use with certain instant messaging protocols.

automatically, without any human intervention. First, we describe the
clustering of demonstrated action sequences into different human types using an
unsupervised learning algorithm. These demonstrated sequences are also used by
the robot to learn a reward function that is representative for each type,
through the employment of an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The
learned model is then used as part of a Mixed Observability Markov Decision
Process formulation, wherein the human type is a partially observable variable.
With this framework, we can infer, either offline or online, the human type of
a new user that was not included in the training set, and can compute a policy
for the robot that will be aligned to the preference of this new user and will
be robust to deviations of the human actions from prior demonstrations. Finally
we validate the approach using data collected in human subject experiments, and
conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations in which a person performs a

  Sampling","In the panoply of pattern classification techniques, few enjoy the intuitive
appeal and simplicity of the nearest neighbor rule: given a set of samples in
some metric domain space whose value under some function is known, we estimate
the function anywhere in the domain by giving the value of the nearest sample
per the metric. More generally, one may use the modal value of the m nearest
samples, where m is a fixed positive integer (although m=1 is known to be
admissible in the sense that no larger value is asymptotically superior in
terms of prediction error). The nearest neighbor rule is nonparametric and
extremely general, requiring in principle only that the domain be a metric
space. The classic paper on the technique, proving convergence under
independent, identically-distributed (iid) sampling, is due to Cover and Hart
(1967). Because taking samples is costly, there has been much research in
recent years on selective sampling, in which each sample is selected from a
pool of candidates ranked by a heuristic; the heuristic tries to guess which
candidate would be the most ""informative"" sample. Lindenbaum et al. (2004)
apply selective sampling to the nearest neighbor rule, but their approach
sacrifices the austere generality of Cover and Hart; furthermore, their
heuristic algorithm is complex and computationally expensive. Here we report
recent results that enable selective sampling in the original Cover-Hart

  solving difficult optimization problems","Reliable global optimization is dedicated to finding a global minimum in the
presence of rounding errors. The only approaches for achieving a numerical
proof of global optimality are interval branch and bound methods that
interleave branching of the search-space and pruning of the subdomains that
cannot contain an optimal solution. It is of the utmost importance: i) to
compute sharp enclosures of the objective function and the constraints on a
given subdomain; ii) to find a good approximation (an upper bound) of the
global minimum.
  State-of-the-art solvers are generally integrative methods, that is they
embed local optimization algorithms to compute a good upper bound of the global
minimum over each subspace. In this document, we propose a cooperative
framework in which interval methods cooperate with evolutionary algorithms. The
latter are stochastic algorithms in which a population of candidate solutions
iteratively evolves in the search-space to reach satisfactory solutions.
Evolutionary algorithms, endowed with operators that help individuals escape
from local minima, are particularly suited for difficult problems on which
traditional methods struggle to converge.
  Within our cooperative solver Charibde, the evolutionary algorithm and the
interval-based algorithm run in parallel and exchange bounds, solutions and

convergence toward local minima. A comparison of Charibde with state-of-the-art

relevance of monoidal closure to automata theory, we also leverage this notion
to give abstract generalizations of the arguments showing that copyless SSTs
may be determinized and that the composition of two regular functions may be
implemented by a copyless SST. Our main result is then generalized from strings

virtual-to-real correspondences, so that a default or an offline display
calibration can be updated to account for the user's eye position(s). Current
alignment-based calibration procedures usually require point-wise alignments
between rendered image point(s) and associated physical landmark(s) of a target

correspondences, repeated alignments are required to ensure calibration
quality.
  This work presents an accurate and tool-less online OST calibration method to
update an offline-calibrated eye-display model. The user's bare hand is
markerlessly tracked by a commercial RGBD camera anchored to the OST headset to

the servers are storage constrained in that they can only store a fraction

achieving PIR protocols when the file size is $N^F$ and complete files were
stored on all the servers. These results were further extended for the case
when servers store only a fraction of each file. However, the subpacketization
$v$ of the files required is exponential in the number of servers $N$. We

also capacity achieving when the file size is $v \times t^F$. Our protocol has
linear subpacketization in the number of servers in contrast to previous work

progress measures, we develop a game-theoretical approach to the solution of
systems of monotone equations over lattices, where for each single equation
either the least or greatest solution is taken. A simple parity game, referred
to as fixpoint game, is defined that provides a correct and complete
characterisation of the solution of equation systems over continuous lattices,
a quite general class of lattices widely used in semantics. For powerset
lattices the fixpoint game is intimately connected with classical parity games
for $\mu$-calculus model-checking, whose solution can exploit as a key tool
Jurdzi\'nski's small progress measures. We show how the notion of progress
measure can be naturally generalised to fixpoint games over continuous lattices
and we prove the existence of small progress measures. Our results lead to a
constructive formulation of progress measures as (least) fixpoints. We refine
this characterisation by introducing the notion of selection that allows one to
constrain the plays in the parity game, enabling an effective (and possibly
efficient) solution of the game, and thus of the associated verification
problem. We also propose a logic for specifying the moves of the existential
player that can be used to systematically derive simplified equations for

about computer programs that operate over them, e.g., in Solidity. The ability

not provide ways to specify summations of arbitrary length.

under virtual machine (VM) abstraction for high performance computing (HPC)
users to run their applications. A HPC cloud is such cloud computing
environment. One of challenges of energy efficient resource allocation for VMs
in HPC cloud is tradeoff between minimizing total energy consumption of
physical machines (PMs) and satisfying Quality of Service (e.g. performance).
On one hand, cloud providers want to maximize their profit by reducing the
power cost (e.g. using the smallest number of running PMs). On the other hand,
cloud customers (users) want highest performance for their applications. In
this paper, we focus on the scenario that scheduler does not know global
information about user jobs and user applications in the future. Users will
request shortterm resources at fixed start times and non interrupted durations.
We then propose a new allocation heuristic (named Energy-aware and Performance
per watt oriented Bestfit (EPOBF)) that uses metric of performance per watt to
choose which most energy-efficient PM for mapping each VM (e.g. maximum of MIPS
per Watt). Using information from Feitelson's Parallel Workload Archive to

  Partitioning","In this thesis, Minimal Partitioning (MP) algorithm, an innovative algorithm
for enumerating all the spanning trees in an undirected graph is presented.
  While MP algorithm uses a computational tree graph to traverse all possible
spanning trees by the edge exchange technique, it has two unique properties
compared to previous algorithms. In the first place, the algorithm maintains a
state of minimal partition size in the spanning tree due to edge deletion. This
is realized by swapping peripheral edges, more precisely leaf edges, in most of
edge exchange operations. Consequently, the main structure of the spanning
trees is preserved during the steps of the enumeration process. This extra
constraint proves to be advantageous in many applications where the partition
size is a factor in the solution cost. Secondly, we introduce, and utilize, the
new concept of edge promotion: the exchanged edges always share one end.
Practically, and as a result of this property, the interface between the two
partitions of the spanning tree during edge exchange has to be maintained from
one side only.
  For a graph $G(V,E)$, MP algorithm requires $O(log V+E/V)$ expected time and
$OV log V)$ worst case time for generating each spanning tree. MP algorithm
requires a total expected space limit of $O(E log V)$ with worst case limit of
$O(EV)$. Like all edge exchange algorithms, MP algorithm retains the advantage
of compacted output of $O(1)$ per spanning tree by listing the relative
differences only.

offering discounts to influential users (called seeding). In many applications,
due to user's privacy concern, overwhelming network scale etc., it is hard to
target any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small subset of
users is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly
impair the influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree
users, which are particularly rare in such a small subset due to the power-law
structure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the limited IM
in real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion
uncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and
assume users accept the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is
depicted by the independent cascade model. To overcome the access limitation,
we prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon that neighbors have
higher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the FP
embedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we
formulate the non-adaptive case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard.
In the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated to users all at once. We show
the monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and design a
two-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In
the adaptive case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of
existing seeding and diffusion results. We prove the adaptive submodularity and

between low-level and high-level semantics (inter-level, e.g. clip-video,
sentence-paragraph), and a cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to connect video

from the design idea of a popular class of quantum algorithms, namely quantum
walk-based algorithms. The generality of this paradigm is guaranteed by the
universality of quantum walks as a computational model. A new quantum
programming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of
superposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of
Dijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL
splits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation
(of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced
in QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct
for realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs.
  The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new
mathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions.
Then the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived.
Another very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming
paradigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily
defined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices
and probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local
variables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be
used in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive
power of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and

efficient data structures and, most notably, hash tables. Cuckoo hashing is a
technique that extends this concept. There,we are given a table with $n$
locations, and we assume that each location can hold one item. Each item to be
inserted chooses randomly k>1 locations and has to be placed in any one of
them. How much load can cuckoo hashing handle before collisions prevent the
successful assignment of the available items to the chosen locations? Practical
evaluations of this method have shown that one can allocate a number of
elements that is a large proportion of the size of the table, being very close
to 1 even for small values of k such as 4 or 5.
  In this paper we show that there is a critical value for this proportion:
with high probability, when the amount of available items is below this value,
then these can be allocated successfully, but when it exceeds this value, the
allocation becomes impossible. We give explicitly for each k>1 this critical
value. This answers an open question posed by Mitzenmacher (ESA '09) and

default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic.
Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be
viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate,
the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy
different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result

theorem, we can directly convert a Shannon's channel into an optimized semantic

the conditional sampling distribution. The third kind of Bayes' theorem is
proved. A semantic information theory is simply introduced. The semantic
information measure reflects Popper's hypothesis-testing thought. The Semantic
Information Method (SIM) adheres to maximum semantic information criterion
which is compatible with maximum likelihood criterion and Regularized Least
Squares criterion. It supports Wittgenstein's view: the meaning of a word lies
in its use. Letting the two channels mutually match, we obtain the Channels'
Matching (CM) algorithm for machine learning. The CM algorithm is used to
explain the evolution of the semantic meaning of natural language, such as ""Old
age"". The semantic channel for medical tests and the confirmation measures of
test-positive and test-negative are discussed. The applications of the CM
algorithm to semi-supervised learning and non-supervised learning are simply
introduced. As a predictive model, the semantic channel fits variable sources
and hence can overcome class-imbalance problem. The SIM strictly distinguishes
statistical probability and logical probability and uses both at the same time.

interleaving for an integer $m$. This generalizes a recent result of Dinur et

information with one another. Though simple reshare cascades have been studied
extensively, the full range of cascading behaviors on social media is much more
diverse. Here we study how diffusion protocols, or the social exchanges that
enable information transmission, affect cascade growth, analogous to the way
communication protocols define how information is transmitted from one point to
another. Studying 98 of the largest information cascades on Facebook, we find a
wide range of diffusion protocols - from cascading reshares of images, which
use a simple protocol of tapping a single button for propagation, to the ALS
Ice Bucket Challenge, whose diffusion protocol involved individuals creating
and posting a video, and then nominating specific others to do the same. We
find recurring classes of diffusion protocols, and identify two key
counterbalancing factors in the construction of these protocols, with
implications for a cascade's growth: the effort required to participate in the
cascade, and the social cost of staying on the sidelines. Protocols requiring
greater individual effort slow down a cascade's propagation, while those
imposing a greater social cost of not participating increase the cascade's
adoption likelihood. The predictability of transmission also varies with
protocol. But regardless of mechanism, the cascades in our analysis all have a
similar reproduction number ($\approx$ 1.8), meaning that lower rates of
exposure can be offset with higher per-exposure rates of adoption. Last, we
show how a cascade's structure can not only differentiate these protocols, but
also be modeled through branching processes. Together, these findings provide a
framework for understanding how a wide variety of information cascades can
achieve substantial adoption across a network.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Complementing this, we exclude polynomial kernels for OCT parameterized by the

given input program. Each analysis pass may generate a program-abstraction.
Each optimization pass is typically composed of multiple alternating phases of
inspection of program-abstractions and transformations of the program. Upon
transformation of a program, the program-abstractions generated by various
analysis passes may become inconsistent with the program's modified state.
Consequently, the downstream transformations may be considered unsafe until the
relevant program-abstractions are stabilized, i.e., the program-abstractions
are made consistent with the modified program. In general, the existing
compiler frameworks do not perform automated stabilization of the
program-abstractions and instead leave it to the optimization writer to deal
with the complex task of identifying the relevant program-abstractions to
stabilize, the points where the stabilization is to be performed, and the exact
procedure of stabilization. Similarly, adding new analyses becomes a challenge
as one has to understand which all existing optimizations may impact the newly
added program-abstractions. In this paper, we address these challenges by
providing the design and implementation of a novel generalized compiler-design
framework called Homeostasis.
  Homeostasis can be used to guarantee the trigger of automated stabilization
of relevant program-abstractions under every possible transformation of the
program. Interestingly, Homeostasis provides such guarantees not only for the
existing optimization passes but also for any future optimizations that may be
added to the framework. We have implemented our proposed ideas in the IMOP

largely independent choice of a set of spatiotemporal patterns that are
considered as all the entities within the Markov chain. For example, the
entity-set can be chosen according to operational closure conditions or
complete specific integration. Importantly, the perception-action loop also

Substring problem. Assume that we are given a set of strings ${\cal S}=\{s_1,
s_2, ..., s_n\}$ of strings, say, each of length $m$. The Closest String
problem asks for the smallest $d$ and a string $s$ of length $m$ which is
within Hamming distance $d$ to each $s_i\in {\cal S}$. This problem comes from
coding theory when we are looking for a code not too far away from a given set
of codes. The problem is NP-hard. Berman et al give a polynomial time algorithm
for constant $d$. For super-logarithmic $d$, Ben-Dor et al give an efficient
approximation algorithm using linear program relaxation technique. The best
polynomial time approximation has ratio 4/3 for all $d$ given by Lanctot et al
and Gasieniec et al. The Closest Substring problem looks for a string $t$ which
is within Hamming distance $d$ away from a substring of each $s_i$. This
problem only has a $2- \frac{2}{2|\Sigma|+1}$ approximation algorithm
previously Lanctot et al and is much more elusive than the Closest String

drug target identification, and genetic probes in molecular biology. Whether
there are efficient approximation algorithms for both problems are major open

  Detection","We introduce a new one-parameter family of divergence measures, called
bounded Bhattacharyya distance (BBD) measures, for quantifying the
dissimilarity between probability distributions. These measures are bounded,
symmetric and positive semi-definite and do not require absolute continuity. In
the asymptotic limit, BBD measure approaches the squared Hellinger distance. A
generalized BBD measure for multiple distributions is also introduced. We prove
an extension of a theorem of Bradt and Karlin for BBD relating Bayes error
probability and divergence ranking. We show that BBD belongs to the class of
generalized Csiszar f-divergence and derive some properties such as curvature
and relation to Fisher Information. For distributions with vector valued
parameters, the curvature matrix is related to the Fisher-Rao metric. We derive
certain inequalities between BBD and well known measures such as Hellinger and
Jensen-Shannon divergence. We also derive bounds on the Bayesian error
probability. We give an application of these measures to the problem of signal

abstract garbage collection skirt just inside the boundaries of soundness and
decidability. Alone, each method reduces analysis times and boosts precision by
orders of magnitude. This work illuminates and conquers the theoretical
challenges that stand in the way of combining the power of these techniques.
The challenge in marrying these techniques is not subtle: computing the
reachable control states of a pushdown system relies on limiting access during
transition to the top of the stack; abstract garbage collection, on the other
hand, needs full access to the entire stack to compute a root set, just as
concrete collection does. \emph{Introspective} pushdown systems resolve this
conflict. Introspective pushdown systems provide enough access to the stack to
allow abstract garbage collection, but they remain restricted enough to compute
control-state reachability, thereby enabling the sound and precise product of
pushdown analysis and abstract garbage collection. Experiments reveal

text documents, considering multiple dimensions of emotion and varying levels
of semantic granularity. Emosaic is grounded in psychological research on the
relationship between language, affect, and color perception. We capitalize on
an established three-dimensional model of human emotion: valence (good, nice
vs. bad, awful), arousal (calm, passive vs. exciting, active) and dominance
(weak, controlled vs. strong, in control). Previously, multi-dimensional models
of emotion have been used rarely in visualizations of textual data, due to the
perceptual challenges involved. Furthermore, until recently most text
visualizations remained at a high level, precluding closer engagement with the
deep semantic content of the text. Informed by empirical studies, we introduce
a color mapping that translates any point in three-dimensional affective space
into a unique color. Emosaic uses affective dictionaries of words annotated
with the three emotional parameters of the valence-arousal-dominance model to
extract emotional meanings from texts and then assigns to them corresponding
color parameters of the hue-saturation-brightness color space. This approach of
mapping emotion to color is aimed at helping readers to more easily grasp the
emotional tone of the text. Several features of Emosaic allow readers to
interactively explore the affective content of the text in more detail; e.g.,
in aggregated form as histograms, in sequential form following the order of
text, and in detail embedded into the text display itself. Interaction
techniques have been included to allow for filtering and navigating of text and

  Consistent Training of Deep Neural Networks","Mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) is favored in deep neural network training to
reduce the computational cost. Still, it introduces an inherent sampling error,
making the selection of appropriate learning rates challenging. The sampling
errors can manifest either as a bias or variances in a line search. Dynamic
MBSS re-samples a mini-batch at every function evaluation. Hence, dynamic MBSS
results in point-wise discontinuous loss functions with smaller bias but larger
variance than static sampled loss functions. However, dynamic MBSS has the
advantage of having larger data throughput during training but requires the
complexity regarding discontinuities to be resolved. This study extends the
gradient-only surrogate (GOS), a line search method using quadratic
approximation models built with only directional derivative information, for
dynamic MBSS loss functions. We propose a gradient-only approximation line
search (GOALS) with strong convergence characteristics with defined optimality
criterion. We investigate GOALS's performance by applying it on various
optimizers that include SGD, RMSprop and Adam on ResNet-18 and EfficientNetB0.

scientists in finding meaningful dependence among features, which can engender

  Correlation algorithms in MATLAB","Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a powerful tool used to evaluate
displacements and deformations in a non-intrusive manner. By comparing two
images, one of the undeformed reference state of a specimen and another of the
deformed target state, the relative displacement between those two states is
determined. DIC is well known and often used for post-processing analysis of
in-plane displacements and deformation of specimen. Increasing the analysis
speed to enable real-time DIC analysis will be beneficial and extend the field
of use of this technique. Here we tested several combinations of the most
common DIC methods in combination with different parallelization approaches in
MATLAB and evaluated their performance to determine whether real-time analysis
is possible with these methods. To reflect improvements in computing technology
different hardware settings were also analysed. We found that implementation
problems can reduce the efficiency of a theoretically superior algorithm such
that it becomes practically slower than a sub-optimal algorithm. The
Newton-Raphson algorithm in combination with a modified Particle Swarm
algorithm in parallel image computation was found to be most effective. This is
contrary to theory, suggesting that the inverse-compositional Gauss-Newton
algorithm is superior. As expected, the Brute Force Search algorithm is the
least effective method. We also found that the correct choice of
parallelization tasks is crucial to achieve improvements in computing speed. A
poorly chosen parallelisation approach with high parallel overhead leads to
inferior performance. Finally, irrespective of the computing mode the correct
choice of combinations of integer-pixel and sub-pixel search algorithms is
decisive for an efficient analysis. Using currently available hardware

the algorithm requires no backtrack (cf. classic sphere decoding), and extracts

the use of soft detection information in iterative schemes. The algorithm is

two 4-dimensional checkerboard lattice): it achieves maximum likelihood
performance in quasistatic fading; and, performs close to interference-free
transmission, and identically to list sphere decoding, in independent fading

ascertaining distributional equivalence of a model replication with its

best explain implementation differences; b) it does not depend on the

computationally demanding, as they may require matching the test samples

different approaches have been developed to reduce the number of required
reference prototypes. Current reduction approaches select a small subset of
representative prototypes in the space induced by the similarity measure, and
then separately train the classification function on the reduced subset.
However, decoupling these two steps may not allow reducing the number of
prototypes effectively without compromising accuracy. We overcome this
limitation by jointly learning the classification function along with an
optimal set of virtual prototypes, whose number can be either fixed a priori or
optimized according to application-specific criteria. Creating a super-sparse
set of virtual prototypes provides much sparser solutions, drastically reducing
complexity at test time, at the expense of a slightly increased complexity

  sequence","Many applications in network analysis require algorithms to sample uniformly
at random from the set of all graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. We
present a Markov chain based approach which converges to the uniform
distribution of all realizations for both the directed and undirected case. It
remains an open challenge whether these Markov chains are rapidly mixing.
  For the case of directed graphs, we also explain in this paper that a popular
switching algorithm fails in general to sample uniformly at random because the
state graph of the Markov chain decomposes into different isomorphic
components. We call degree sequences for which the state graph is strongly
connected arc swap sequences. To handle arbitrary degree sequences, we develop
two different solutions. The first uses an additional operation (a
reorientation of induced directed 3-cycles) which makes the state graph
strongly connected, the second selects randomly one of the isomorphic
components and samples inside it. Our main contribution is a precise
characterization of arc swap sequences, leading to an efficient recognition
algorithm. Finally, we point out some interesting consequences for network

  element-based algorithm for warping triangular and tetrahedral meshes","We consider an algorithm called FEMWARP for warping triangular and
tetrahedral finite element meshes that computes the warping using the finite
element method itself. The algorithm takes as input a two- or three-dimensional
domain defined by a boundary mesh (segments in one dimension or triangles in
two dimensions) that has a volume mesh (triangles in two dimensions or
tetrahedra in three dimensions) in its interior. It also takes as input a
prescribed movement of the boundary mesh. It computes as output updated
positions of the vertices of the volume mesh. The first step of the algorithm
is to determine from the initial mesh a set of local weights for each interior
vertex that describes each interior vertex in terms of the positions of its
neighbors. These weights are computed using a finite element stiffness matrix.
After a boundary transformation is applied, a linear system of equations based
upon the weights is solved to determine the final positions of the interior
vertices. The FEMWARP algorithm has been considered in the previous literature
(e.g., in a 2001 paper by Baker). FEMWARP has been succesful in computing
deformed meshes for certain applications. However, sometimes FEMWARP reverses
elements; this is our main concern in this paper. We analyze the causes for

Connected Degree Parity Editing$(S)$ (CDPE($S$)) to be the problem that takes

graph $H$ with $d_{H}(v)\equiv\delta(v)~(\bmod~2)$ for each $v\in V(H)$, using
at most $k$ operations from $S$. We prove that
  1. if $S=\{ea\}$ or $S=\{ea,ed\}$, then CDPE($S$) can be solved in polynomial
time;
  2. if $\{vd\} \subseteq S\subseteq \{ea,ed,vd\}$, then CDPE($S$) is
NP-complete and W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k$, even if $\delta\equiv 0$.
  Together with known results by Cai and Yang and by Cygan, Marx, Pilipczuk,

specifications -- from continuous joint control to discrete end-effector pose
control. However, these robot-centric interfaces often require skilled
operators with extensive robotics expertise. To make teleoperation accessible
to non-expert users, we propose the framework ""Scene Editing as Teleoperation""
(SEaT), where the key idea is to transform the traditional ""robot-centric""
interface into a ""scene-centric"" interface -- instead of controlling the robot,
users focus on specifying the task's goal by manipulating digital twins of the
real-world objects. As a result, a user can perform teleoperation without any
expert knowledge of the robot hardware. To achieve this goal, we utilize a
category-agnostic scene-completion algorithm that translates the real-world
workspace (with unknown objects) into a manipulable virtual scene
representation and an action-snapping algorithm that refines the user input
before generating the robot's action plan. To train the algorithms, we
procedurally generated a large-scale, diverse kit-assembly dataset that
contains object-kit pairs that mimic real-world object-kitting tasks. Our
experiments in simulation and on a real-world system demonstrate that our
framework improves both the efficiency and success rate for 6DoF kit-assembly
tasks. A user study demonstrates that SEaT framework participants achieve a
higher task success rate and report a lower subjective workload compared to an
alternative robot-centric interface. Video can be found at

  Subjects and Intruders, Transparency to Users","There are currently two approaches to anonymization: ""utility first"" (use an
anonymization method with suitable utility features, then empirically evaluate
the disclosure risk and, if necessary, reduce the risk by possibly sacrificing
some utility) or ""privacy first"" (enforce a target privacy level via a privacy
model, e.g., k-anonymity or epsilon-differential privacy, without regard to
utility). To get formal privacy guarantees, the second approach must be
followed, but then data releases with no utility guarantees are obtained. Also,
in general it is unclear how verifiable is anonymization by the data subject
(how safely released is the record she has contributed?), what type of intruder
is being considered (what does he know and want?) and how transparent is
anonymization towards the data user (what is the user told about methods and
parameters used?).
  We show that, using a generally applicable reverse mapping transformation,
any anonymization for microdata can be viewed as a permutation plus (perhaps) a
small amount of noise; permutation is thus shown to be the essential principle
underlying any anonymization of microdata, which allows giving simple utility
and privacy metrics. From this permutation paradigm, a new privacy model
naturally follows, which we call (d,v)-permuted privacy. The privacy ensured by
this method can be verified by each subject contributing an original record
(subject-verifiability) and also at the data set level by the data protector.
We then proceed to define a maximum-knowledge intruder model, which we argue
should be the one considered in anonymization. Finally, we make the case for
anonymization transparent to the data user, that is, compliant with Kerckhoff's
assumption (only the randomness used, if any, must stay secret).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

  Geometry Projection","This work presents a computational method for the design of architected truss
lattice materials where each strut can be made of one of a set of available
materials. We design the lattices to extremize effective properties. As
customary in topology optimization, we design a periodic unit cell of the
lattice and obtain the effective properties via numerical homogenization. Each
bar is represented as a cylindrical offset surface of a medial axis
parameterized by the positions of the endpoints of the medial axis. These
parameters are smoothly mapped onto a continuous density field for the primal
and sensitivity analysis via the geometry projection method. A size variable
per material is ascribed to each bar and penalized as in density-based topology
optimization to facilitate the entire removal of bars from the design. During
the optimization, we allow bars to be made of a mixture of the available
materials. However, to ensure each bar is either exclusively made of one
material or removed altogether from the optimal design, we impose optimization
constraints that ensure each size variable is 0 or 1, and that at most one
material size variable is 1. The proposed material interpolation scheme readily
accommodates any number of materials. To obtain lattices with desired material
symmetries, we design only a reference region of the unit cell and reflect its
geometry projection with respect to the appropriate planes of symmetry. Also,
to ensure bars remain whole upon reflection inside the unit cell or with
respect to the periodic boundaries, we impose a no-cut constraint on the bars.

addressed. This study focuses on citation recommendation in the related studies
section by applying the term function of a citation context, potentially

Design/methodology/approach: We present nine term functions with three newly
created and six identified from existing literature. Using these term functions
as labels, we annotate 531 research papers in three topics to evaluate our
proposed recommendation strategy. BM25 and Word2vec with VSM are implemented as
the baseline models for the recommendation. Then the term function information
is applied to enhance the performance. Findings: The experiments show that the
term function-based methods outperform the baseline methods regarding the
recall, precision, and F1-score measurement, demonstrating that term functions
are useful in identifying valuable citations. Research limitations: The dataset
is insufficient due to the complexity of annotating citation functions for

should be performed to future validate the proposed approach. Practical
implications: The citation recommendation strategy can be helpful for valuable

major drawbacks. First, the specific entropy profile of encrypted data makes
their detection very easy. Second, the use of cryptography can be more or less
regulated, not to say forbidden, according to the countries. If the right to
freely protect our personal and private data is a fundamental right, it must
not hinder the action of Nation States with respect to National security.
Allowing encryption to citizens holds for bad guys as well.
  In this paper we propose a new approach in information and communication
security that may solve all these issues, thus representing a rather
interesting trade-off between apparently opposite security needs. We introduce
the concept of scalable security based on computationnally hard problem of
coding theory with the PERSEUS technology.
  The core idea is to encode date with variable punctured convolutional codes
in such a way that any cryptanalytic attempt will require a time-consuming
encoder reconstruction in order to decode. By adding noise in a suitable way,
that reconstruction becomes untractable in practice except for Intelligence
services that however must use supercomputers during a significant, scalable
amount of time. Hence it limits naturally any will to unduly performs such
attacks (eg. against citizens' privacy).
  On the users' side, encoder and noise parameters are first exchanged through
an initial, short HTTPS session. The principles behind that approach have been
mathematically validated in 1997 and 2007. We present the PERSEUS library we

introducing 16 biomarkers, three of which are orthogonal, demonstrating
simultaneous above state-of-the-art discrimination for apparently unrelated

scholars, departments, and institutions. A widely used measure of scientific
impact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting
the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of
such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law
distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are
extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.
Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked
by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: ""Will
this paper increase my h-index?"" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7
million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from
the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific
impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to
increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority
on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are
crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the
topic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little
relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%
potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's
h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a
self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that
it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current
h-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of
scientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more

general intelligence. It involves repeated interaction requiring learning in
the form of adaption to the human conversation partner. It is a macro-level
post-hoc test in contrast to the definition of a Turing Machine (TM), which is
a prior micro-level definition. This raises the question of whether learning is
just another computational process, i.e. can be implemented as a TM. Here we
argue that learning or adaption is fundamentally different from computation,
though it does involve processes that can be seen as computations. To
illustrate this difference we compare (a) designing a TM and (b) learning a TM,
defining them for the purpose of the argument. We show that there is a
well-defined sequence of problems which are not effectively designable but are
learnable, in the form of the bounded halting problem. Some characteristics of
human intelligence are reviewed including it's: interactive nature, learning
abilities, imitative tendencies, linguistic ability and context-dependency. A
story that explains some of these is the Social Intelligence Hypothesis. If
this is broadly correct, this points to the necessity of a considerable period
of acculturation (social learning in context) if an artificial intelligence is
to pass the TT. Whilst it is always possible to 'compile' the results of
learning into a TM, this would not be a designed TM and would not be able to

address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research
questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open

network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to
the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs.
full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other
modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like
oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a
comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated
with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance
increases - consistently across modalities - with the spatial context of the
input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed
data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing
size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to
whole images) yielded a mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.89

$\mathcal{H}$ of $H$, the extension problem asks whether $\mathcal{H}$ can be
extended into a drawing of $G$ while maintaining some desired property of the
drawing (e.g., planarity).
  In their breakthrough result, Angelini et al. [ACM TALG 2015] showed that the
extension problem is polynomial-time solvable when the aim is to preserve
planarity. Very recently we considered this problem for partial 1-planar
drawings [ICALP 2020], which are drawings in the plane that allow each edge to
have at most one crossing. The most important question identified and left open
in that work is whether the problem can be solved in polynomial time when $H$
can be obtained from $G$ by deleting a bounded number of vertices and edges. In
this work, we answer this question positively by providing a constructive
polynomial-time decision algorithm.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Problems modulo k","Generalised Satisfiability Problems (or Boolean Constraint Satisfaction
Problems), introduced by Schaefer in 1978, are a general class of problem which
allow the systematic study of the complexity of satisfiability problems with
different types of constraints. In 1979, Valiant introduced the complexity
class parity P, the problem of counting the number of solutions to NP problems
modulo two. Others have since considered the question of counting modulo other
integers.
  We give a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of counting the number of
solutions to Generalised Satisfiability Problems modulo integers. This follows
from an earlier result of Creignou and Hermann which gave a counting dichotomy
for these types of problem, and the dichotomy itself is almost identical.
Specifically, counting the number of solutions to a Generalised Satisfiability

infinite game graphs. A winning strategy for such a game is positional if it
only depends on the current position, and not on the history of the play. A
game is positionally determined if, from each position, one of the two players
has a positional winning strategy.
  The theory of such games is well studied for winning conditions that are
defined in terms of a mapping that assigns to each position a priority from a
finite set. Specifically, in Muller games the winner of a play is determined by
the set of those priorities that have been seen infinitely often; an important
special case are parity games where the least (or greatest) priority occurring
infinitely often determines the winner. It is well-known that parity games are
positionally determined whereas Muller games are determined via finite-memory
strategies.
  In this paper, we extend this theory to the case of games with infinitely
many priorities. Such games arise in several application areas, for instance in
pushdown games with winning conditions depending on stack contents.
  For parity games there are several generalisations to the case of infinitely
many priorities. While max-parity games over omega or min-parity games over
larger ordinals than omega require strategies with infinite memory, we can
prove that min-parity games with priorities in omega are positionally
determined. Indeed, it turns out that the min-parity condition over omega is
the only infinitary Muller condition that guarantees positional determinacy on

subexponential algorithm with complexity $2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}$, which is
asymptotically the same as the currently best known time complexity for the
graph isomorphism (GI) problem. Moreover, we prove that the graph isomorphism
problem on 3-colorable graphs with diameter 2 is GI-complete. Furthermore we
present a subclass of graphs with diameter 2 that admits a polynomial algorithm

3-coloring by proving that for every $\varepsilon \in [0,1)$, 3-coloring is
NP-complete on triangle-free graphs of diameter 3 and radius 2 with $n$

task more accurately than their best individual members; and five times faster
than dyads using explicit communication. Furthermore, our computational
analyses indicate that the haptic channel affords implicit confidence sharing.
We found that dyads take leadership over the choice and communicate their

produces a y such that $\norm{y - \pinv{A} b}_{A} \leq \epsilon \norm{\pinv{A}

approximate Fiedler vectors in a similar amount of time. The algorithm applies
subgraph preconditioners in a recursive fashion. These preconditioners improve
upon the subgraph preconditioners first introduced by Vaidya (1990).
  For any symmetric, weakly diagonally-dominant matrix A with non-positive

commonly used type of decision tree is the alphabetic binary tree, which uses
(without loss of generality) ``less than'' versus ''greater than or equal to''
tests in order to determine one of $n$ outcome events. The process of finding
an optimal alphabetic binary tree for a known probability distribution on
outcome events usually has the underlying assumption that the cost (time) per
decision is uniform and thus independent of the outcome of the decision. This
assumption, however, is incorrect in the case of software to be optimized for a
given microprocessor, e.g., in compiling switch statements or in fine-tuning
program bottlenecks. The operation of the microprocessor generally means that
the cost for the more likely decision outcome can or will be less -- often far
less -- than the less likely decision outcome. Here we formulate a variety of
$O(n^3)$-time $O(n^2)$-space dynamic programming algorithms to solve such
optimal binary decision tree problems, optimizing for the behavior of
processors with predictive branch capabilities, both static and dynamic. In the
static case, we use existing results to arrive at entropy-based performance
bounds. Solutions to this formulation are often faster in practice than
``optimal'' decision trees as formulated in the literature, and, for small
problems, are easily worth the extra complexity in finding the better solution.

  Reinforcement Learning","Designing agents, capable of learning autonomously a wide range of skills is
critical in order to increase the scope of reinforcement learning. It will both
increase the diversity of learned skills and reduce the burden of manually
designing reward functions for each skill. Self-supervised agents, setting
their own goals, and trying to maximize the diversity of those goals have shown
great promise towards this end. However, a currently known limitation of agents
trying to maximize the diversity of sampled goals is that they tend to get
attracted to noise or more generally to parts of the environments that cannot
be controlled (distractors). When agents have access to predefined goal
features or expert knowledge, absolute Learning Progress (ALP) provides a way
to distinguish between regions that can be controlled and those that cannot.
However, those methods often fall short when the agents are only provided with
raw sensory inputs such as images. In this work we extend those concepts to
unsupervised image-based goal exploration. We propose a framework that allows
agents to autonomously identify and ignore noisy distracting regions while
searching for novelty in the learnable regions to both improve overall
performance and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our framework can be combined
with any state-of-the-art novelty seeking goal exploration approaches. We
construct a rich 3D image based environment with distractors. Experiments on

volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine
learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of
social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical
problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when
applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be
particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of

designed to be computationally cheap while still achieving high approximation
quality. The concept, which we call \emph{Laplace Matching}, involves
closed-form, approximate, bi-directional transformations between the parameter
spaces of exponential families. These are constructed from Laplace
approximations under custom-designed basis transformations. The mappings can
then be leveraged to effectively turn a latent Gaussian distribution into a
conjugate prior for a rich class of observable variables. This effectively
turns inference in GLMs into conjugate inference (with small approximation
errors). We empirically evaluate the method in two different GLMs, showing
approximation quality comparable to state-of-the-art approximate inference
techniques at a drastic reduction in computational cost. More specifically, our
method has a cost comparable to the \emph{very first} step of the iterative

Strategies (ESs) in order to address a class of global optimization problems
that could benefit from fine discretization of their decision variables. Such
problems arise in engineering and scientific applications, which possess a
multi-resolution control nature, and thus may be formulated either by means of
low-resolution variants (providing coarser approximations with presumably lower
accuracy for the general problem) or by high-resolution controls. A particular
scientific application concerns practical Quantum Control (QC) problems, whose
targeted optimal controls may be discretized to increasingly higher resolution,
which in turn carries the potential to obtain better control yields. However,
state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization heuristics for high-resolution
formulations nominally call for an impractically large number of objective
function calls. Therefore, an effective algorithmic treatment for such problems
is needed. We introduce a framework with an automated scheme to facilitate
guided-search over increasingly finer levels of control resolution for the
optimization problem, whose on-the-fly learned parameters require careful
adaptation. We instantiate the proposed m-lev self-adaptive ES framework by two
specific strategies, namely the classical elitist single-child (1+1)-ES and the
non-elitist multi-child derandomized $(\mu_W,\lambda)$-sep-CMA-ES. We first

credibility. This has triggered many researchers to develop new methods for
studying, understanding, detecting, and preventing fake-news diffusion; as a
consequence, thousands of scientific papers have been published in a relatively
short period, making researchers of different disciplines to struggle in search
of open problems and most relevant trends. The aim of this survey is threefold:
first, we want to provide the researchers interested in this multidisciplinary

to assist them with a visual exploration of papers that can be of interest;
second, we present a selection of the main results achieved so far adopting the

diffusion processes, and to evaluate different debunking strategies. Finally,
we present an outline of the most relevant research trends focusing on the
moving target of fake-news, bots, and trolls identification by means of data

  Programming with Algebraic Measures","Dealing with context dependent knowledge has led to different formalizations
of the notion of context. Among them is the Contextualized Knowledge Repository
(CKR) framework, which is rooted in description logics but links on the
reasoning side strongly to logic programs and Answer Set Programming (ASP) in
particular. The CKR framework caters for reasoning with defeasible axioms and
exceptions in contexts, which was extended to knowledge inheritance across
contexts in a coverage (specificity) hierarchy. However, the approach supports
only this single type of contextual relation and the reasoning procedures work
only for restricted hierarchies, due to non-trivial issues with model
preference under exceptions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations and
present a generalization of CKR hierarchies to multiple contextual relations,
along with their interpretation of defeasible axioms and preference. To support
reasoning, we use ASP with algebraic measures, which is a recent extension of
ASP with weighted formulas over semirings that allows one to associate
quantities with interpretations depending on the truth values of propositional
atoms. Notably, we show that for a relevant fragment of CKR hierarchies with
multiple contextual relations, query answering can be realized with the popular

some classes from the (truth-table) bounded-query and boolean hierarchies. It
is well-known that if either of these hierarchies collapses at a given level,
then all higher levels of that hierarchy collapse to that same level. This is a
standard ``upward translation of equality'' that has been known for over a
decade. The issue of whether these hierarchies can translate equality {\em
downwards\/} has proven vastly more challenging. In particular, with regard to
the figure above, consider the following claim:
  $$P_{m-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} = P_{m+1-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} \implies
  DIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) coDIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) = BH(\Sigma_k^p). (*) $$
  This claim, if true, says that equality translates downwards between levels
of the bounded-query hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy levels that (before
the fact) are immediately below them.
  Until recently, it was not known whether (*) {\em ever\/} held, except for
the degenerate cases $m=0$ and $k=0$. Then Hemaspaandra, Hemaspaandra, and
Hempel \cite{hem-hem-hem:j:downward-translation} proved that (*) holds for all
$m$, for $k > 2$. Buhrman and Fortnow~\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries} then showed
that, when $k=2$, (*) holds for the case $m = 1$. In this paper, we prove that
for the case $k=2$, (*) holds for all values of $m$. Since there is an oracle
relative to which ``for $k=1$, (*) holds for all $m$'' fails
\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries}, our achievement of the $k=2$ case cannot to be
strengthened to $k=1$ by any relativizable proof technique. The new downward

systems based on a relatively recent theory in immunology called Danger theory.
Based on Danger theory, immune response in natural systems is a result of
sensing corruption as well as sensing unknown substances. In contrast,
traditional self-nonself discrimination theory states that immune response is
only initiated by sensing nonself (unknown) patterns. Danger theory solves many
problems that could only be partially explained by the traditional model.
Although the traditional model is simpler, such problems result in high false
positive rates in immune-inspired intrusion detection systems. We believe using
danger theory in a multi-agent environment that computationally emulates the
behavior of natural immune systems is effective in reducing false positive
rates. We first describe a simplified scenario of immune response in natural
systems based on danger theory and then, convert it to a computational model as
a network protocol. In our protocol, we define several immune signals and model
cell signaling via message passing between agents that emulate cells. Most
messages include application-specific patterns that must be meaningfully
extracted from various system properties. We show how to model these messages
in practice by performing a case study on the problem of detecting distributed

  information control in biological systems","Cellular automata have been useful artificial models for exploring how
relatively simple rules combined with spatial memory can give rise to complex
emergent patterns. Moreover, studying the dynamics of how rules emerge under
artificial selection for function has recently become a powerful tool for
understanding how evolution can innovate within its genetic rule space.
However, conventional cellular automata lack the kind of state feedback that is
surely present in natural evolving systems. Each new generation of a population
leaves an indelible mark on its environment and thus affects the selective
pressures that shape future generations of that population. To model this
phenomenon, we have augmented traditional cellular automata with
state-dependent feedback. Rather than generating automata executions from an
initial condition and a static rule, we introduce mappings which generate
iteration rules from the cellular automaton itself. We show that these new
automata contain disconnected regions which locally act like conventional
automata, thus encapsulating multiple functions into one structure.
Consequently, we have provided a new model for processes like cell
differentiation. Finally, by studying the size of these regions, we provide
additional evidence that the dynamics of self-reference may be critical to

fashion-conscious, and members of polarized echo chambers. We demonstrate that
a small portion of nomadic agents that widely traverse belief space can disrupt
a larger population of stampeding agents. Extending the model, we introduce the

its own information. In a way, the centralized failure diagnosis of SDESs can
be viewed as a special case of the decentralized failure diagnosis presented in
this paper with only one projection. The main contributions are as follows: (1)
We formalize the notion of codiagnosability for stochastic automata, which
means that a failure can be detected by at least one local stochastic diagnoser
within a finite delay. (2) We construct a codiagnoser from a given stochastic
automaton with multiple projections, and the codiagnoser associated with the
local diagnosers is used to test codiagnosability condition of SDESs. (3) We
deal with a number of basic properties of the codiagnoser. In particular, a
necessary and sufficient condition for the codiagnosability of SDESs is
presented. (4) We give a computing method in detail to check whether
codiagnosability is violated. And (5) some examples are described to illustrate
the applications of the codiagnosability and its computing method.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

semi-implicit time integrators are commonly used in operational atmospheric
forecast models. They guarantee the stable treatment of fast (acoustic and
gravity) waves, while not suffering from severe restrictions on the timestep
size. To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear
equation for the prognostic variables has to be solved at every timestep. Since
the nonlinearity is typically weak, this is done with a small number of Newton-
or Picard- iterations, which in turn require the efficient solution of a large
system on linear equations with $\mathcal{O}(10^6-10^9)$ unknowns. This linear
solve is often the computationally most costly part of the model. In this paper
an efficient linear solver for the LFRic next-generation model, currently
developed by the Met Office, is described. The model uses an advanced mimetic
finite element discretisation which makes the construction of efficient solvers
challenging compared to models using standard finite-difference and
finite-volume methods. The linear solver hinges on a bespoke multigrid
preconditioner of the Schur-complement system for the pressure correction. By
comparing to Krylov-subspace methods, the superior performance and robustness
of the multigrid algorithm is demonstrated for standard test cases and
realistic model setups. In production mode, the model will have to run in

reduced to rule-based programming. To this end we explain first how one can
compute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple
first-order formulas. Then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that
are based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. To solve them we first
derive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation
process to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling.We
consider here two types of rules. The first type, that we call equality rules,
leads to a new notion of local consistency, called {\em rule consistency} that
turns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity
(called hyper-arc consistency in \cite{MS98b}). For Boolean constraints rule
consistency coincides with the closure under the well-known propagation rules
for Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call membership
rules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show
feasibility of this rule-based approach to constraint programming we show how
both types of rules can be automatically generated, as {\tt CHR} rules of
\cite{fruhwirth-constraint-95}. This yields an implementation of this approach
to programming by means of constraint logic programming. We illustrate the
usefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various
examples, including Boolean constraints, two typical examples of many valued

the RMQ query: given an interval $[a,b]\subseteq[1,n]$, return the index of the
minimum element in subarray $A[a\ldots b]$, i.e. return
$\text{argmin}_{i\in[a,b]}A[i]$. The fundamental problem has a long history.

Gabow, Bentley, Tarjan (STOC 1984) and Harel, Tarjan (SICOMP 1984) dates back
to 1980s. The state-of-the-art solution is presented by Fischer, Heun (SICOMP
2011) and Navarro, Sadakane (TALG 2014). The solution uses $2n-1.5\log
n+n/\left(\frac{\log n}{t}\right)^t+\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ bits of space and
$O(t)$ query time, where the additive $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ is a pre-computed
lookup table used in the RAM model, assuming the word-size is $\Theta(\log n)$
bits. On the other hand, the only known lower bound is proved by Liu and Yu
(STOC 2020). They show that any data structure which solves RMQ in $t$ query
time must use $2n-1.5\log n+n/(\log n)^{O(t^2\log^2t)}$ bits of space, assuming
the word-size is $\Theta(\log n)$ bits.

querying mechanism is that, despite being both simple and declarative, it can
be applied to a wide range of extraction tasks. A problem in querying natural
language text though is that a user-specified query may not retrieve enough
exact matches. Unlike term queries which can be relaxed by removing some of the
terms (as is done in search engines), removing terms from a wild card query
without ruining its meaning is more challenging. Also, any query expansion has
the potential to introduce false positives. In this paper, we address the

regulation. For instance, in the medical domain, there are various statues at
the state and federal level that dictate who is permitted to work with
patients' records and under what conditions. To screen for potential privacy
breaches, logging systems are usually deployed to trigger alerts whenever
suspicious access is detected. However, such mechanisms are often inefficient
because 1) the vast majority of triggered alerts are false positives, 2) small
budgets make it unlikely that a real attack will be detected, and 3) attackers
can behave strategically, such that traditional auditing mechanisms cannot
easily catch them. To improve efficiency, information systems may invoke
signaling, so that whenever a suspicious access request occurs, the system can,
in real time, warn the user that the access may be audited. Then, at the close
of a finite period, a selected subset of suspicious accesses are audited. This
gives rise to an online problem in which one needs to determine 1) whether a
warning should be triggered and 2) the likelihood that the data request event
will be audited. In this paper, we formalize this auditing problem as a
Signaling Audit Game (SAG), in which we model the interactions between an
auditor and an attacker in the context of signaling and the usability cost is
represented as a factor of the auditor's payoff. We study the properties of its
Stackelberg equilibria and develop a scalable approach to compute its solution.

uses an n dimensional hashed grid based approach which is based on mapping the

groups like SO(3), SE(3) and their n-wise products SO(3)^n, SE(3)^n is
fundamental to numerous applications in computational and data sciences. The
natural measure of sampling quality is discrepancy. In this work, our main goal
is construct low discrepancy deterministic samplings in product spaces of the

size (from the trivial direct product). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first nontrivial construction for SO(3)^n, SE(3)^n and the hypertorus T^n.

examples for finitely presented non-Hopfian two-generator groups. Since then,
they served as examples for a wide range of purposes. As Baumslag-Solitar
groups are HNN extensions, there is a natural generalization in terms of graph
of groups.
  Concerning algorithmic aspects of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups,
several decidability results are known. Indeed, a straightforward application
of standard algorithms leads to a polynomial time solution of the word problem
(the question whether some word over the generators represents the identity of
the group). The conjugacy problem (the question whether two given words
represent conjugate group elements) is more complicated; still decidability has
been established by Anshel and Stebe for ordinary Baumslag-Solitar groups and
for generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups independently by Lockhart and Beeker.
However, up to now no precise complexity estimates have been given.
  In this work, we give a LOGSPACE algorithm for both problems. More precisely,
we describe a uniform TC^0 many-one reduction of the word problem to the word
problem of the free group. Then we refine the known techniques for the
conjugacy problem and show that it can be solved in LOGSPACE. Moreover, for
ordinary Baumslag-Solitar groups also conjugacy is AC^0-Turing-reducible to the
word problem of the free group.

  Revival of Flow-Based Programming for the Industrial Internet of Things","When we consider the application layer of networked infrastructures, data and
control flow are important concerns in distributed systems integration.
Modularity is a fundamental principle in software design, in particular for
distributed system architectures. Modularity emphasizes high cohesion of
individual modules and low coupling between modules. Microservices are a recent
modularization approach with the specific requirements of independent
deployability and, in particular, decentralized data management. Cohesiveness
of microservices goes hand-in-hand with loose coupling, making the development,
deployment, and evolution of microservice architectures flexible and scalable.
However, in our experience with microservice architectures, interactions and
flows among microservices are usually more complex than in traditional,
monolithic enterprise systems, since services tend to be smaller and only have
one responsibility, causing collaboration needs. We suggest that for loose
coupling among microservices, explicit control-flow modeling and execution with
central workflow engines should be avoided on the application integration
level. On the level of integrating microservices, data-flow modeling should be
dominant. Control-flow should be secondary and preferably delegated to the
microservices. We discuss coupling in distributed systems integration and
reflect the history of business process modeling with respect to data and
control flow. To illustrate our recommendations, we present some results for

multiserver jobs, where the waiting time of a job is the time spent in queueing
rather than in service. We first consider the commonly used
First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) policy and characterize the exact order of its
mean waiting time. We then prove a lower bound on the mean waiting time of all
policies, and demonstrate that there is an order gap between this lower bound
and the mean waiting time under FCFS. We finally complement the lower bound
with an achievability result: we show that under a priority policy that we call
P-Priority, the mean waiting time achieves the order of the lower bound. This
achievability result implies the tightness of the lower bound, the asymptotic
optimality of P-Priority, and the strict suboptimality of FCFS.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

we investigate to which extent a computational model based on kinematics can

same or not. However, the model produces more false hits and has a greater
selection bias than human participants. A possible reason for this is the
particular sensitivity of the model towards kinematic primitives of the
presented actions. In a second experiment, human participants' performance on
an action identification task indicated that they relied solely on kinematic

$(r,cr,p_1,p_2)$-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than $r$
collide with probability at least $p_1$ while data points with a distance
greater than $cr$ collide with probability at most $p_2$. These functions form
the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest
neighbour problems. In particular one may build a $c$-approximate nearest
neighbour data structure with query time $\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1)$ where
$\rho=\frac{\log1/p_1}{\log1/p_2}\in(0,1)$. That is, sub-linear time, as long
as $p_1$ is not too small. This is significant since most high dimensional
nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can't
be solved exact, faster than a brute force linear-time scan of the database.
  Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision
probabilities, $p_1$ and $p_2$. Including the best functions for Cosine and
Jaccard Similarity. This means that the $n^\rho/p_1$ query time of LSH is often
not sub-linear after all, even for approximate nearest neighbours!
  In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the
query time of LSH to $\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1^{1-\rho})$ (and the space usage
correspondingly.) Since $n^\rho p_1^{\rho-1} < n \Leftrightarrow p_1 > n^{-1}$,
our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for any collision
probabilities at least $1/n$. For $p_1$ and $p_2$ small enough, our improvement
over all previous methods can be \emph{up to a factor $n$} in both query time

an undirected graph with non-negative real weights on the edges and an error
threshold $\varepsilon$, how efficiently can we decide whether we can round all
weights such that shortest paths are maintained, and the change of weight of
each shortest path is less than $\varepsilon$? So far, only for path-shaped
graphs a polynomial-time algorithm was known. In this paper we prove, by

  and reductions","In this paper we consider the problems of testing isomorphism of tensors,
$p$-groups, cubic forms, algebras, and more, which arise from a variety of
areas, including machine learning, group theory, and cryptography. These
problems can all be cast as orbit problems on multi-way arrays under different
group actions. Our first two main results are:
  1. All the aforementioned isomorphism problems are equivalent under
polynomial-time reductions, in conjunction with the recent results of
Futorny-Grochow-Sergeichuk (Lin. Alg. Appl., 2019).
  2. Isomorphism of $d$-tensors reduces to isomorphism of 3-tensors, for any $d
\geq 3$.
  Our results suggest that these isomorphism problems form a rich and robust
equivalence class, which we call Tensor Isomorphism-complete, or TI-complete.
We then leverage the techniques used in the above results to prove two
first-of-their-kind results for Group Isomorphism (GpI):
  3. We give a reduction from GpI for $p$-groups of exponent $p$ and small
class ($c < p$) to GpI for $p$-groups of exponent $p$ and class 2. The latter
are widely believed to be the hardest cases of GpI, but as far as we know, this
is the first reduction from any more general class of groups to this class.
  4. We give a search-to-decision reduction for isomorphism of $p$-groups of
exponent $p$ and class 2 in time $|G|^{O(\log \log |G|)}$. While
search-to-decision reductions for Graph Isomorphism (GI) have been known for
more than 40 years, as far as we know this is the first non-trivial
search-to-decision reduction in the context of GpI.
  Our main technique for (1), (3), and (4) is a linear-algebraic analogue of
the classical graph coloring gadget, which was used to obtain the

architectural slicing is designed to operate on the architectural specification

slicing provides knowledge about the high-level structure of a software system,

most commonly studied data depth measures because it possesses many desirable
properties for data depth functions. The data depth contours bound regions of
increasing depth. For the sample case, there are two competing definitions of

  In this paper, we present three dynamic algorithms for maintaining the
half-space depth of points and contours: The first maintains the half-space
depth of a single point in a data set in $O(\log n)$ time per update
(insertion/deletion) and overall linear space. By maintaining such a data
structure for each data point, we present an algorithm for dynamically
maintaining the rank-based contours in $O(n\cdot\log n)$ time per update and

contours in $O(n\cdot \log^2 n)$ time per update and overall quadratic space.

management is to deal with increasing HOs experienced by a mobile user. To
address this problem, HO skipping techniques have been studied in recent years.
In this paper, we propose a novel HO skipping scheme, namely, time-based HO
skipping. In the proposed scheme, HOs of a user are controlled by a certain
fixed period of time, which we call skipping time. The skipping time can be
managed as a system parameter, thereby enabling flexible operation of HO
skipping. We analyze the transmission performance of the proposed scheme on the
basis of a stochastic geometry approach. In the scenario where a user performs
the time-based HO skipping, we derive the analytical expressions for two
performance metrics: the HO rate and the expected data rate. The analysis

building resource-aware models that can make efficient use of the hard-ware

layer-type. Our analysis of predictive models show that simple layer-type
features achieve a model complexity of 4 to 32 times less for convolutional
layer predictions for a similar accuracy compared to predictive models using
more complex features adopted by previous approaches. To obtain an overall

effect of the hyperbolicity measure $\delta$ on expansion and cut-size bounds

popularity in fluid mechanics due to their spontaneity and low processing time
instead of high fidelity CFD simulations. Auto encoders are used as model order
reduction tools in applications of fluid mechanics by compressing input
high-dimensional data using an encoder to map the input space into a
lower-dimensional latent space. Whereas, generative models such as Variational

be effective in generating solutions to chaotic models with high 'randomness'

generated by parameterizing into some basic statistical characteristics. The
models trained on pre-simulated data from dependencies on these characteristics
and the flow generation is then affected by varying these parameters. The

applications like cleaning, industrial inspection, patrolling, and precision
agriculture. The problem of covering a given environment using multiple robots
can be naturally formulated and studied as a multi-Traveling Salesperson
Problem (mTSP). In a mTSP, the environment is represented as a graph and the
goal is to find tours (starting and ending at the same depot) for the robots in
order to visit all the vertices with minimum global cost, namely the length of
the longest tour. The mTSP is an NP-hard problem for which several
approximation algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms usually assume
generic environments, but tighter approximation bounds can be reached focusing
on specific environments. In this paper, we address the case of environments
composed of sub-parts, called modules, that can be reached from each other only
through some linking structures. Examples are multi-floor buildings, in which
the modules are the floors and the linking structures are the staircases or the
elevators, and floors of large hotels or hospitals, in which the modules are
the rooms and the linking structures are the corridors. We focus on linear
modular environments, with the modules organized sequentially, presenting an
efficient (with polynomial worst-case time complexity) algorithm that finds a
solution for the mTSP whose cost is within a bounded distance from the cost of
the optimal solution. The main idea of our algorithm is to allocate disjoint
""blocks"" of adjacent modules to the robots, in such a way that each module is

  minimization of smooth L2-regularized loss functions, with implementation in
  Apache Spark","In large-scale unconstrained optimization algorithms such as limited memory
BFGS (LBFGS), a common subproblem is a line search minimizing the loss function
along a descent direction. Commonly used line searches iteratively find an
approximate solution for which the Wolfe conditions are satisfied, typically
requiring multiple function and gradient evaluations per line search, which is
expensive in parallel due to communication requirements. In this paper we
propose a new line search approach for cases where the loss function is
analytic, as in least squares regression, logistic regression, or low rank
matrix factorization. We approximate the loss function by a truncated Taylor
polynomial, whose coefficients may be computed efficiently in parallel with
less communication than evaluating the gradient, after which this polynomial
may be minimized with high accuracy in a neighbourhood of the expansion point.
Our Polynomial Expansion Line Search (PELS) was implemented in the Apache Spark
framework and used to accelerate the training of a logistic regression model on
binary classification datasets from the LIBSVM repository with LBFGS and the
Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient (NCG) method. In large-scale numerical experiments
in parallel on a 16-node cluster with 256 cores using the URL, KDDA, and KDDB

compared to the use of classical Wolfe line searches. For example, to reach the
final training label prediction accuracies, LBFGS using PELS had speedup
factors of 1.8--2 over LBFGS using a Wolfe line search, measured by both the
number of iterations and the time required, due to the better accuracy of step

  Extensions","In systems involving quantitative data, such as probabilistic, fuzzy, or
metric systems, behavioural distances provide a more fine-grained comparison of
states than two-valued notions of behavioural equivalence or behaviour
inclusion. Like in the two-valued case, the wide variation found in system
types creates a need for generic methods that apply to many system types at
once. Approaches of this kind are emerging within the paradigm of universal
coalgebra, based either on lifting pseudometrics along set functors or on
lifting general real-valued (fuzzy) relations along functors by means of fuzzy
lax extensions. An immediate benefit of the latter is that they allow bounding
behavioural distance by means of fuzzy (bi-)simulations that need not
themselves be hemi- or pseudometrics; this is analogous to classical
simulations and bisimulations, which need not be preorders or equivalence
relations, respectively. The known generic pseudometric liftings, specifically
the generic Kantorovich and Wasserstein liftings, both can be extended to yield
fuzzy lax extensions, using the fact that both are effectively given by a
choice of quantitative modalities. Our central result then shows that in fact
all fuzzy lax extensions are Kantorovich extensions for a suitable set of
quantitative modalities, the so-called Moss modalities. For nonexpansive fuzzy
lax extensions, this allows for the extraction of quantitative modal logics
that characterize behavioural distance, i.e. satisfy a quantitative version of
the Hennessy-Milner theorem; equivalently, we obtain expressiveness of a

hashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If
labels for data are given, one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning
algorithms. However, many proposed learning methods do not consider the
hyperplanes' offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions,
and the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes
small. In this paper, we propose a lift map that converts learning algorithms
without the offsets to the ones that take into account the offsets. With this
method, the learning methods without the offsets give the discretizations of
spaces as if it takes into account the offsets. For the proposed method, we

The particles are automata with discrete internal states but continuous

repulsive forces. The particles can be assembled into patterns that can encode
arbitrary strings of bits. We demonstrate that, if an arbitrary ""seed"" pattern
is put in a ""soup"" of separate individual particles, the pattern will replicate
by assembling the individual particles into copies of itself. We also show

  Improve Satellite-based Maps in New Regions","Crop type mapping at the field level is critical for a variety of
applications in agricultural monitoring, and satellite imagery is becoming an
increasingly abundant and useful raw input from which to create crop type maps.
Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains
constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised
classification models. When training data is not available in one region,
classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the
distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between
regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that
uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting
for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type
composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior
probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for
shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in
the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to
substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in
Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that
in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications
ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training
departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were
6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was

flexibly steer traffic from a source to a destination through a sequence of
virtualized middleboxes, in order to realize so-called service chains. The

finding suitable locations to allocate the virtualized middleboxes and
computing corresponding routing paths. This paper considers the offline batch

maximizing the profit by embedding an optimal subset of requests or minimizing
the costs when all requests need to be embedded. Interestingly, while the
service chain embedding problem has recently received much attention, so far,
only non- polynomial time algorithms (based on integer programming) as well as
heuristics (which do not provide any formal guarantees) are known. This paper
presents the first polynomial time service chain approximation algorithms both

software. This memoir proposes a regimen to verify such algorithms at
prescribed levels of statistical confidence. The United States Department of
Defense standard for system safety engineering (MIL-STD-882E) defines
development procedures for safety-critical systems. However, a problem exists:
the Standard fails to distinguish quantitative product assurance technique from
categorical process assurance method for software development. Resulting is
conflict in the technical definition of the term risk. The primary goal here is
to show that a quantitative risk-based product assurance method exists and is
consistent with hardware practice. Discussion appears in two major parts:
theory, which shows the relationship between automata and software; and
application, which covers demonstration and indemnification. Demonstration is a
technique for generating random tests; indemnification converts pass/fail test
results to compound Poisson parameters (severity and intensity). Together,
demonstration and indemnification yield statistical confidence that
safety-critical code meets design intent. Statistical confidence is the
keystone of quantitative product assurance. A secondary goal is resolving the
conflict over the term risk. The first meaning is an accident model known in
mathematics as the compound Poisson stochastic process, and so is called
statistical risk. Various of its versions underlie the theories of safety and
reliability. The second is called developmental risk. It considers software
autonomy, which considers time until manual recovery of control. Once these
meanings are separated, MIL-STD-882 can properly support either formal
quantitative safety assurance or empirical process robustness, which differ in

difficulty linked to document stream processing; and a realistic case that
combined all of these difficulties. The realistic case highlighted the fact
that there is a significant drop in the efficiency of NN-Based document

polynomial time. Otherwise, if H is an irreflexive bipartite permutation graph

H-colourings is equivalent to #BIS, the problem of approximately counting
independent sets in a bipartite graph. This is a well-studied problem which is

difficult counting problems in #P. For every other graph H, approximately
counting list H-colourings is complete for #P with respect to
approximation-preserving reductions (so there is no FPRAS unless NP=RP). Two
pleasing features of the trichotomy are (i) it has a natural formulation in
terms of hereditary graph classes, and (ii) the proof is largely self-contained

The edge labels of such a path have to form a word that matches a given regular
expression. We investigate the evaluation of RPQs with an additional constraint
that prevents multiple traversals of the same nodes. Those regular simple path
queries (RSPQs) find several applications in practice, yet they quickly become
intractable, even for basic languages such as (aa)* or a*ba*.
  In this paper, we establish a comprehensive classification of regular
languages with respect to the complexity of the corresponding regular simple
path query problem. More precisely, we identify the fragment that is maximal in
the following sense: regular simple path queries can be evaluated in polynomial
time for every regular language L that belongs to this fragment and evaluation
is NP-complete for languages outside this fragment. We thus fully characterize
the frontier between tractability and intractability for RSPQs, and we refine
our results to show the following trichotomy: Evaluations of RSPQs is either
AC0, NL-complete or NP-complete in data complexity, depending on the regular
language L. The fragment identified also admits a simple characterization in
terms of regular expressions.
  Finally, we also discuss the complexity of the following decision problem:
decide, given a language L, whether finding a regular simple path for L is
tractable. We consider several alternative representations of L: DFAs, NFAs or
regular expressions, and prove that this problem is NL-complete for the first
representation and PSPACE-complete for the other two. As a conclusion we extend

far resisted many attempts of formal analysis or positive constructions.
Specifically, we prove that, in Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model, when
restricted to use only noncooperative bindings, any long enough path that can
grow in all terminal assemblies is pumpable, meaning that this path can be
extended into an infinite, ultimately periodic path.
  This result can be seen as a geometric generalization of the pumping lemma of
finite state automata, and closes the question of what can be computed
deterministically in this model. Moreover, this question has motivated the
development of a new method called visible glues. We believe that this method
can also be used to tackle other long-standing problems in computational
geometry, in relation for instance with self-avoiding paths.
  Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly) was originally
introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand how to program
shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1 tile assembly,
is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they match on one side,
whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to match on several sides
in order to bind. In this work, we prove that only very simple shapes can
indeed be programmed, whereas exactly one known result (SODA 2014) showed a
restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative self-assembly could
achieve, without any implication on its computational expressiveness. With

buildings. A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functional
areas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and room
level localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usage
reduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based upon
this observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person or
a mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,
however, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.
  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic
acoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for
infrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can be
characterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining precise
RIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of our
work are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system is
implemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm
is developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,
a comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted from

Morphogenetic programming is illustrated by two examples: (1) use of a modified
flocking algorithm to route dense fiber bundles between regions of an
artificial cortex while avoiding other bundles; (2) use of the
clock-and-wavefront model of spinal segmentation for the assembly of the
segmented spine of an insect-like robot body and for assembling segmented legs

  classes","Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite family of graphs. We consider the following
meta-problem, called $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion: given a graph $G$ and
integer $k$, decide whether the deletion of at most $k$ edges of $G$ can result
in a graph that does not contain any graph from $\mathcal{F}$ as an immersion.
This problem is a close relative of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion problem
studied by Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], where one deletes vertices in order to
remove all minor models of graphs from $\mathcal{F}$.
  We prove that whenever all graphs from $\mathcal{F}$ are connected and at
least one graph of $\mathcal{F}$ is planar and subcubic, then the
$\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion problem admits: a constant-factor
approximation algorithm running in time $O(m^3 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$; a
linear kernel that can be computed in time $O(m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$; and
a $O(2^{O(k)} + m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$-time fixed-parameter algorithm,
where $n,m$ count the vertices and edges of the input graph.
  These results mirror the findings of Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], who obtained a
similar set of algorithmic results for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion, under the
assumption that at least one graph from $\mathcal{F}$ is planar. An important
difference is that we are able to obtain a linear kernel for
$\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion, while the exponent of the kernel of Fomin et
al. for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion depends heavily on the family
$\mathcal{F}$. In fact, this dependence is unavoidable under plausible
complexity assumptions, as proven by Giannopoulou et al. [ICALP 2015]. This

logistics, infectious disease control, and counter-terrorism. In the typical
formulation of network interdiction, the task of the interdictor is to find a
set of edges in a weighted network such that the removal of those edges would
maximally increase the cost to an evader of traveling on a path through the
network.
  Our work is motivated by cases in which the evader has incomplete information
about the network or lacks planning time or computational power, e.g. when
authorities set up roadblocks to catch bank robbers, the criminals do not know
all the roadblock locations or the best path to use for their escape.
  We introduce a model of network interdiction in which the motion of one or
more evaders is described by Markov processes and the evaders are assumed not
to react to interdiction decisions. The interdiction objective is to find an
edge set of size B, that maximizes the probability of capturing the evaders.
  We prove that similar to the standard least-cost formulation for
deterministic motion this interdiction problem is also NP-hard. But unlike that
problem our interdiction problem is submodular and the optimal solution can be
approximated within 1-1/e using a greedy algorithm. Additionally, we exploit
submodularity through a priority evaluation strategy that eliminates the linear
complexity scaling in the number of network edges and speeds up the solution by
orders of magnitude. Taken together the results bring closer the goal of

that reduces path length while meeting the requirements of a good range-free
localization technique. In this paper we propose two cost-effective movement
strategies i.e., path planning for a mobile anchor so that localization can be
done using the localization scheme \cite{Lee2009}. In one strategy we use a
hexagonal movement pattern for the mobile anchor to localize all sensors inside
a bounded rectangular region with lesser movement compared to the existing
works in literature. In other strategy we consider a connected network in an
unbounded region where the mobile anchor moves in the hexagonal pattern to
localize the sensors. In this approach, we guarantee localization of all

surprising that there exist a plethora of sorting algorithms. For all the
sorting algorithms, it is an accepted performance limit that sorting algorithms
are linearithmic or O(N lg N). The linearithmic lower bound in performance
stems from the fact that the sorting algorithms use the ordering property of
the data. The sorting algorithm uses comparison by the ordering property to
arrange the data elements from an initial permutation into a sorted
permutation.
  Linear O(N) sorting algorithms exist, but use a priori knowledge of the data
to use a specific property of the data and thus have greater performance. In
contrast, the linearithmic sorting algorithms are generalized by using a
universal property of data-comparison, but have a linearithmic performance
lower bound. The trade-off in sorting algorithms is generality for performance
by the chosen property used to sort the data elements.
  A general-purpose, linear sorting algorithm in the context of the trade-off

  Polygon","Let $s$ be a source point and $t$ be a destination point inside an $n$-vertex
simple polygon $P$. Euclidean shortest paths and minimum-link paths between $s$
and $t$ inside $P$ have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple
and piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths in the context of
diffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a
light source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the
turning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A
diffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of
turning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The
minimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the
minimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained
open.
  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse
reflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a
new kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection
path where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the
Euclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave
exactly once. For computing a minimum constrained diffuse reflection path from
$s$ to $t$, we present an $O(n(n+\beta))$ time algorithm, where $\beta =\Theta
(n^2)$ in the worst case. Here, $\beta$ depends on the shape of the polygon. We
also establish some properties relating minimum constrained diffuse reflection
paths and minimum diffuse reflection paths. Constrained diffuse reflection
paths introduced in this paper provide new geometric insights into the hitherto
unknown structures and shapes of optimal reflection paths.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

separating the highly predictive feature from those that might be irrelevant or
redundant. Information theory has been recognized as a useful concept for this
task, as the prediction power stems from the correlation, i.e., the mutual
information, between features and labels. Many algorithms for feature selection
in the literature have adopted the Shannon-entropy-based mutual information. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of using R\'enyi min-entropy instead. In
particular, we propose an algorithm based on a notion of conditional R\'enyi
min-entropy that has been recently adopted in the field of security and
privacy, and which is strictly related to the Bayes error. We prove that in
general the two approaches are incomparable, in the sense that we show that we
can construct datasets on which the R\'enyi-based algorithm performs better
than the corresponding Shannon-based one, and datasets on which the situation
is reversed. In practice, however, when considering datasets of real data, it
seems that the R\'enyi-based algorithm tends to outperform the other one. We

groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial

and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the

sentence selection approach on the frequency of concepts extracted from the

frequency for identifying the valuable content of the input document, and
considering the correlations existing between concepts may be more useful for
this type of summarization. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian summarizer
for biomedical text documents. The Bayesian summarizer initially maps the input
text to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts, then it selects
the important ones to be used as classification features. We introduce
different feature selection approaches to identify the most important concepts
of the text and to select the most informative content according to the

feature selection approach, the Bayesian biomedical summarizer can improve the
performance of summarization. We perform extensive evaluations on a corpus of

environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work
explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents,
hence treating people as sensors. Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is
an inherently multimodal problem; a driver may behave similarly for different
occupancy patterns ahead of them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in
traffic or on an open road). Past work, however, does not account for this
multimodality, thus neglecting to model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in
the relationship between driver behaviors and their environment. We propose an
occlusion inference method that characterizes observed behaviors of human
agents as sensor measurements, and fuses them with those from a standard sensor
suite. To capture the aleatoric uncertainty, we train a conditional variational
autoencoder with a discrete latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from
observed driver trajectories to an occupancy grid representation of the view
ahead of the driver. Our method handles multi-agent scenarios, combining
measurements from multiple observed drivers using evidential theory to solve
the sensor fusion problem. Our approach is validated on a cluttered, real-world

high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces, which mitigates the effects

graph-regularization terms are often added to the loss function. However, the
prior graph construction often fails to reflect the true network connectivity

fail to take the dual spaces into account. Probabilistic models are often used
to model the distribution of the representations, but most of previous methods
often assume that the hidden variables are independent and identically
distributed for simplicity. To this end, we propose a learnable
graph-regularization model for matrix decomposition (LGMD), which builds a
bridge between graph-regularized methods and probabilistic matrix decomposition
models. LGMD learns two graphical structures (i.e., two precision matrices) in

The hierarchical graph pooling layers are then involved to downsample graph

is an error-correcting code that encodes each message
$\vec{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}) \in F_{q}^{n}$ to $C(\vec{x}) \in F_{q}^{N}$
and has the following property: For any $\vec{y} \in {\bf F}_{q}^{N}$ such that

$x_{i}$ of $\vec{x}$ can be recovered with probability at least $1-\epsilon$ by

The efficiency of a $(k,\delta,\epsilon)$-locally decodable code $C: F_{q}^{n}

queries. For any $k$-query locally decodable code $C: F_{q}^{n} \to F_{q}^{N}$,
the code length $N$ is conjectured to be exponential of $n$, however, this was
disproved. Yekhanin [In Proc. of STOC, 2007] showed that there exists a 3-query

Efremenko [ECCC Report No.69, 2008] reduced the code length further to

coding of wavelet image decomposition coefficients succeed only because typical
images being compressed possess a significant degree of self-similarity.
Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly
related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to
another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.
  The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in
regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and
similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically
related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly
transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove
that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the
root of a zerotree, or its branch.
  The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients
as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of
a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This
interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression
techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view
predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer

methodologies and tools. Formal verification techniques often conflict with the
time constraints imposed by change management practices for evolving systems.
Since changes in these systems are often local to restricted parts, an
incremental verification approach could be beneficial.
  This paper introduces SiDECAR, a general framework for the definition of
verification procedures, which are made incremental by the framework itself.
Verification procedures are driven by the syntactic structure (defined by a
grammar) of the system and encoded as semantic attributes associated with the
grammar. Incrementality is achieved by coupling the evaluation of semantic
attributes with an incremental parsing technique.
  We show the application of SiDECAR to the definition of two verification
procedures: probabilistic verification of reliability requirements and
verification of safety properties.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

variables $n$ is a variable part of the input. We consider two natural
parameters of the constraint matrix $A$: its numeric measure $a$ and its
sparsity measure $d$. We show that integer programming can be solved in time
$g(a,d)\textrm{poly}(n,L)$, where $g$ is some computable function of the
parameters $a$ and $d$, and $L$ is the binary encoding length of the input. In
particular, integer programming is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by
$a$ and $d$, and is solvable in polynomial time for every fixed $a$ and $d$.
Our results also extend to nonlinear separable convex objective functions.
Moreover, for linear objectives, we derive a strongly-polynomial algorithm,
that is, with running time $g(a,d)\textrm{poly}(n)$, independent of the rest of
the input data.
  We obtain these results by developing an algorithmic framework based on the
idea of iterative augmentation: starting from an initial feasible solution, we
show how to quickly find augmenting steps which rapidly converge to an optimum.
A central notion in this framework is the Graver basis of the matrix $A$, which
constitutes a set of fundamental augmenting steps. The iterative augmentation
idea is then enhanced via the use of other techniques such as new and improved
bounds on the Graver basis, rapid solution of integer programs with bounded
variables, proximity theorems and a new proximity-scaling algorithm, the notion
of a reduced objective function, and others.
  As a consequence of our work, we advance the state of the art of solving
block-structured integer programs. In particular, we develop near-linear time
algorithms for $n$-fold, tree-fold, and $2$-stage stochastic integer programs.

on general networks with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs. We show how to solve the
problem in $O(mn)$ time, when $m = O(n^{2-\epsilon})$, for some $0 <\epsilon
\leq 1$. This improves upon the results of both Orlin and King, et. al., who
solved the problem in $O(mn + m^{31/16} \log^2 n)$ and $O(mn\log_{m/n\log n}n)$
time, respectively. Our main result is reducing the number of nonsaturating
pushes to $O(mn)$ across all scaling phases. Our algorithm can be seen as
complementary to King, et. al., in the sense that we solve the max-flow problem
in $O(mn)$ time when $m = O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ (all sparse and non-dense
networks), whereas King, et. al. solve it in $O(mn)$ time when $m =
\Omega(n^{1+\epsilon})$ (all dense and non-sparse networks).
  Our improvement is reached by a novel combination of Ahuja and Orlin's excess
scaling method and Orlin's compact flow networks. To our knowledge, this is the
first $O(mn)$ time max-flow algorithm that runs on this range of networks.
Further, we extend the range of Orlin's $O(mn)$ time algorithm from
$O(n^{16/15-\epsilon})$ to $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$, which is an improvement of
approximately $O(n^{0.94})$. Our result also establishes that the problem can
be solved for all $n$ and $m$ using exclusively the push-relabel method. We

  schemes with radial basis function","This paper is concerned with a few novel RBF-based numerical schemes
discretizing partial differential equations. For boundary-type methods, we
derive the indirect and direct symmetric boundary knot methods (BKM). The
resulting interpolation matrix of both is always symmetric irrespective of
boundary geometry and conditions. In particular, the direct BKM applies the
practical physical variables rather than expansion coefficients and becomes
very competitive to the boundary element method. On the other hand, based on
the multiple reciprocity principle, we invent the RBF-based boundary particle
method (BPM) for general inhomogeneous problems without a need using inner
nodes. The direct and symmetric BPM schemes are also developed.
  For domain-type RBF discretization schemes, by using the Green integral we
develop a new Hermite RBF scheme called as the modified Kansa method (MKM),
which differs from the symmetric Hermite RBF scheme in that the MKM discretizes
both governing equation and boundary conditions on the same boundary nodes. The
local spline version of the MKM is named as the finite knot method (FKM). Both
MKM and FKM significantly reduce calculation errors at nodes adjacent to
boundary. In addition, the nonsingular high-order fundamental or general
solution is strongly recommended as the RBF in the domain-type methods and dual
reciprocity method approximation of particular solution relating to the BKM.
  It is stressed that all the above discretization methods of boundary-type and
domain-type are symmetric, meshless, and integration-free. The spline-based

  the K-Means Clustering Algorithm","Over the past five decades, k-means has become the clustering algorithm of
choice in many application domains primarily due to its simplicity, time/space
efficiency, and invariance to the ordering of the data points. Unfortunately,
the algorithm's sensitivity to the initial selection of the cluster centers
remains to be its most serious drawback. Numerous initialization methods have
been proposed to address this drawback. Many of these methods, however, have
time complexity superlinear in the number of data points, which makes them
impractical for large data sets. On the other hand, linear methods are often
random and/or sensitive to the ordering of the data points. These methods are
generally unreliable in that the quality of their results is unpredictable.
Therefore, it is common practice to perform multiple runs of such methods and
take the output of the run that produces the best results. Such a practice,
however, greatly increases the computational requirements of the otherwise
highly efficient k-means algorithm. In this chapter, we investigate the
empirical performance of six linear, deterministic (non-random), and
order-invariant k-means initialization methods on a large and diverse
collection of data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results

core of numerous data mining and machine learning applications, including data
diversification, data summarization, and coverage problems. In this work, we
study this question in the context of data streams, where elements arrive one
at a time, and we want to design low-memory and fast update-time algorithms
that maintain a good solution. Specifically, we focus on the sliding window
model, where we are asked to maintain a solution that considers only the last
$W$ items.
  In this context, we provide the first non-trivial algorithm that maintains a
provable approximation of the optimum using space sublinear in the size of the
window. In particular we give a $\frac{1}{3} - \epsilon$ approximation
algorithm that uses space polylogarithmic in the spread of the values of the
elements, $\Phi$, and linear in the solution size $k$ for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$ . At the same time, processing each element only requires a
polylogarithmic number of evaluations of the function itself. When a better
approximation is desired, we show a different algorithm that, at the cost of
using more memory, provides a $\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon$ approximation and allows
a tunable trade-off between average update time and space. This algorithm
matches the best known approximation guarantees for submodular optimization in
insertion-only streams, a less general formulation of the problem.

difference, changes the language recognized and yields more efficient parsing

show that cuts, a mechanism for controlling backtracks in PEGs, finds also a
natural representation in our framework. We generalize such mechanism, allowing
for both local and global cuts with a precise, unified and formal semantics.
Hence, our work strives at better understanding and controlling backtracks in

solid modeling. However, the few proposed solutions are limited to the problem
of decomposing solids described through their boundaries. In this thesis we
study the problem of decomposing an arbitrary non-manifold simplicial complex

using combinatorial topology. The proposed decomposition is unique, for a given
complex, and is computable for complexes of any dimension. A decomposition
algorithm is proposed that is linear w.r.t. the size of the input. In three or
higher dimensions a decomposition into manifold parts is not always possible.
Thus, in higher dimensions, we decompose a non-manifold into a decidable super
class of manifolds, that we call, Initial-Quasi-Manifolds. We also defined a
two-layered data structure, the Extended Winged data structure. This data
structure is a dimension independent data structure conceived to model
non-manifolds through their decomposition into initial-quasi-manifold parts.
Our two layered data structure describes the structure of the decomposition and
each component separately. In the second layer we encode the connectivity
structure of the decomposition. We analyze the space requirements of the
Extended Winged data structure and give algorithms to build and navigate it.
Finally, we discuss time requirements for the computation of topological
relations and show that, for surfaces and tetrahedralizations, embedded in real
3D space, all topological relations can be extracted in optimal time. This

embedded systems and replicated databases to cloud computing. Due to
asynchronous communication, process faults, or network failures, these
algorithms are difficult to design and verify. Many algorithms achieve fault
tolerance by using threshold guards that, for instance, ensure that a process
waits until it has received an acknowledgment from a majority of its peers.
Consequently, domain-specific languages for fault-tolerant distributed systems
offer language support for threshold guards.
  We introduce an automated method for model checking of safety and liveness of
threshold-guarded distributed algorithms in systems where the number of
processes and the fraction of faulty processes are parameters. Our method is
based on a short counterexample property: if a distributed algorithm violates a
temporal specification (in a fragment of LTL), then there is a counterexample
whose length is bounded and independent of the parameters. We prove this
property by (i) characterizing executions depending on the structure of the
temporal formula, and (ii) using commutativity of transitions to accelerate and
shorten executions. We extended the ByMC toolset (Byzantine Model Checker) with
our technique, and verified liveness and safety of 10 prominent fault-tolerant
distributed algorithms, most of which were out of reach for existing
techniques.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This book explores an alternative idea where the future of science is based on
the language of algorithms and programs. How such a language can actually be
implemented in the sciences is outlined in some detail. We start by
constructing a simple formal system where statements are represented as
programs and inference is based on computability as opposed to the classical
notion of truth value assignments.
  The focus is on theories where the intrinsic properties and dynamic state of
real world objects can be defined in terms of information and subject to laws
based on simple deterministic rules and finite state arithmetic. Such models,
it is argued, not only offer alternative simulation tools, as opposed to those
based on discrete approximations of conventional continuum theories, but in
themselves can be regarded as a language that describes the physical laws at a
fundamental level. This book does not examine any specific application in
detail but rather attempts to lay down a foundation for the validation of such
theories by employing the inference scheme based on computability logic.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

integrals that model the physics of light transport in virtual scenes for
computer graphics applications. These methods rely on the law of large numbers
to estimate expectations via simulation, typically resulting in slow
convergence. Their errors usually manifest as undesirable grain in the pictures
generated by image synthesis algorithms. It is well known that these errors
diminish when the samples are chosen appropriately. A well known technique for
reducing error operates by subdividing the integration domain, estimating
integrals in each \emph{stratum} and aggregating these values into a stratified
sampling estimate. Na\""{i}ve methods for stratification, based on a lattice
(grid) are known to improve the convergence rate of Monte Carlo, but require
samples that grow exponentially with the dimensionality of the domain.
  We propose a simple stratification scheme for $d$ dimensional hypercubes
using the kd-tree data structure. Our scheme enables the generation of an
arbitrary number of equal volume partitions of the rectangular domain, and $n$
samples can be generated in $O(n)$ time. Since we do not always need to
explicitly build a kd-tree, we provide a simple procedure that allows the
sample set to be drawn fully in parallel without any precomputation or storage,
speeding up sampling to $O(\log n)$ time per sample when executed on $n$ cores.
If the tree is implicitly precomputed ($O(n)$ storage) the parallelised run
time reduces to $O(1)$ on $n$ cores. In addition to these benefits, we provide
an upper bound on the worst case star-discrepancy for $n$ samples matching that

our framework also promotes the quality of pseudo-labels during the

extends beyond the static realm of predicates, to the dynamic realm of
processes. Understanding the logical parallelism of process propositions and
dynamic types was one of the central problems of the semantics of computation,
albeit not always clear or explicit. It sprung into clarity through the early
work of Samson Abramsky, where the central ideas of denotational semantics and
process calculus were brought together and analyzed by categorical tools, e.g.
in the structure of interaction categories. While some logical structures borne
of dynamics of computation immediately started to emerge, others had to wait,
be it because the underlying logical principles (mainly those arising from
coinduction) were not yet sufficiently well-understood, or simply because the
research community was more interested in other semantical tasks. Looking back,
it seems that the process logic uncovered by those early semantical efforts
might still be starting to emerge and that the vast field of results that have
been obtained in the meantime might be a valley on a tip of an iceberg.

key individuals in a social network. This raises privacy concerns that are
likely to exacerbate in the future. With this in mind, we ask the question: Can
individuals or groups actively manage their connections to evade social network
analysis tools?
  By addressing this question, the general public may better protect their
privacy, oppressed activist groups may better conceal their existence, and
security agencies may better understand how terrorists escape detection. We
first study how an individual can evade ""network centrality"" analysis without
compromising his or her influence within the network. We prove that an optimal
solution to this problem is hard to compute. Despite this hardness, we
demonstrate that even a simple heuristic, whereby attention is restricted to
the individual's immediate neighbourhood, can be surprisingly effective in
practice. For instance, it could disguise Mohamed Atta's leading position
within the WTC terrorist network, and that is by rewiring a strikingly-small
number of connections. Next, we study how a community can increase the
likelihood of being overlooked by community-detection algorithms. We propose a
measure of concealment, expressing how well a community is hidden, and use it

meet the needs of modern multicore and big data systems. DRAM device density
and maximum device count are constrained by technology, package, and signal in-
tegrity issues that limit total memory capacity. Synchronous DRAM protocols
require data to be returned within a fixed latency, and thus memory extension
methods over commodity DDRx interfaces fail to support scalable topologies.
Current extension approaches either use slow PCIe interfaces, or require
expensive changes to the memory interface, which limits commercial
adoptability. Here we propose twin-load, a lightweight asynchronous memory
access mechanism over the synchronous DDRx interface. Twin-load uses two
special loads to accomplish one access request to extended memory, the first
serves as a prefetch command to the DRAM system, and the second asynchronously
gets the required data. Twin-load requires no hardware changes on the processor
side and only slight soft- ware modifications. We emulate this system on a
prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Twin-load has
comparable performance to NUMA extended memory and outperforms a page-swapping
PCIe-based system by several orders of magnitude. Twin-load thus enables

remembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our

polynomial-size Turing kernels when restricted to planar graphs, graphs of

alone. These results contrast existing superpolynomial lower bounds for the

there is no polynomial-time algorithm that reduces any instance $(G,k)$ to a

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10361v1,Neural Face Models for Example-Based Visual Speech Synthesis,"Creating realistic animations of human faces with computer graphic models is
still a challenging task. It is often solved either with tedious manual work or
motion capture based techniques that require specialised and costly hardware.
Example based animation approaches circumvent these problems by re-using
captured data of real people. This data is split into short motion samples that
can be looped or concatenated in order to create novel motion sequences. The
obvious advantages of this approach are the simplicity of use and the high
realism, since the data exhibits only real deformations. Rather than tuning
weights of a complex face rig, the animation task is performed on a higher
level by arranging typical motion samples in a way such that the desired facial
performance is achieved. Two difficulties with example based approaches,
however, are high memory requirements as well as the creation of artefact-free
and realistic transitions between motion samples. We solve these problems by
combining the realism and simplicity of example-based animations with the
advantages of neural face models. Our neural face model is capable of
synthesising high quality 3D face geometry and texture according to a compact
latent parameter vector. This latent representation reduces memory requirements
by a factor of 100 and helps creating seamless transitions between concatenated
motion samples. In this paper, we present a marker-less approach for facial
motion capture based on multi-view video. Based on the captured data, we learn
a neural representation of facial expressions, which is used to seamlessly
concatenate facial performances during the animation procedure. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach by synthesising mouthings for Swiss-German

show that the SOS relaxation of minimum order 2 empirically solves the original

least squares (TLS) robust cost function and leveraging graduated non-convexity
to solve TLS without initialization. The result is a robust reconstruction

approached the problem of estimating flow lengths from sampled packet data in
two separate ways. Firstly, different sampling methodologies can be tried to
more accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the
sample-and-hold method where, if a packet is sampled, all subsequent packets in
that flow are sampled. Secondly, statistical methods can be used to ``invert''
the sampled data and produce an estimate of flow lengths from a sample.
  In this paper we propose, implement and test two variants on the
sample-and-hold method. In addition we show how the sample-and-hold method can
be inverted to get an estimation of the genuine distribution of flow sizes.

model-checking. The small number of molecules reported for this system tests
the limits of the continuous approximation underlying differential equations.

us to formulate new hypotheses on the system behaviour, such as the presence of
self-sustained oscillations in single cells under constant light conditions.
  We investigate how to model the timing of dawn and dusk in the context of
model-checking, which we use to compute how the probability distributions of
key biochemical species change over time. These show that the relative
variation in expression level is smallest at the time of peak expression,
making peak time an optimal experimental phase marker. Building on these
analyses, we use approaches from evolutionary systems biology to investigate

structures with numerous applications. Since hash table accesses can dominate
the execution time of the overall application, we need implementations that
achieve good speedup. Unfortunately, currently available concurrent hashing
libraries turn out to be far away from this requirement in particular when
contention on some elements occurs.
  Our starting point for better performing data structures is a fast and simple
lock-free concurrent hash table based on linear probing that is limited to
word-sized key-value types and does not support dynamic size adaptation. We
explain how to lift these limitations in a provably scalable way and
demonstrate that dynamic growing has a performance overhead comparable to the
same generalization in sequential hash tables.
  We perform extensive experiments comparing the performance of our
implementations with six of the most widely used concurrent hash tables. Ours

an order of magnitude faster than the best more general tables. In some extreme

opposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or

politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and
displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's

works that use headline guided attention to learn a headline derived contextual
representation of the news body also result in convoluting overall
representation due to the news body's lengthiness. This paper proposes a method
that uses inter-mutual attention-based semantic matching between the original

all pairs of word embeddings of words involved. The paper also investigates two

addition, we can measure the probability that a page about one broad topic will
link to another broad topic. Extending this experiment, we can measure how
quickly topic context is lost while walking randomly on the Web graph.

  graphs","Random $s$-intersection graphs have recently received much interest in a wide
range of application areas. Broadly speaking, a random $s$-intersection graph
is constructed by first assigning each vertex a set of items in some random
manner, and then putting an undirected edge between all pairs of vertices that
share at least $s$ items (the graph is called a random intersection graph when
$s=1$). A special case of particular interest is a uniform random
$s$-intersection graph, where each vertex independently selects the same number
of items uniformly at random from a common item pool. Another important case is
a binomial random $s$-intersection graph, where each item from a pool is
independently assigned to each vertex with the same probability. Both models
have found numerous applications thus far including cryptanalysis, and the
modeling of recommender systems, secure sensor networks, online social
networks, trust networks and small-world networks (uniform random
$s$-intersection graphs), as well as clustering analysis, classification, and
the design of integrated circuits (binomial random $s$-intersection graphs).

moving away from the search for a single ranking function and toward a search

disjunctive termination argument is used. In this paper, we describe a new
technique for determining whether programs terminate. Our technique is applied

an $O(n^{1/3})$-round algorithm when the multiplication needs to be performed
over a semi-ring, and an $O(n^{0.157})$-round algorithm when the computation
can be performed over a field. We propose to denote by $\kappa$ the exponent of
matrix multiplication in this model, which gives $\kappa < 0.157$.
  We show how to compute all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) in $O(n^{1/3}\log{n})$
rounds in weighted graphs of $n$ nodes, implying also the computation of the
graph diameter $D$. In unweighted graphs, APSP can be computed in
$O(\min\{n^{1/3}\log{D},n^{\kappa} D\})$ rounds, and the diameter can be
computed in $O(n^{\kappa}\log{D})$ rounds. Furthermore, we show how to compute
the girth of a graph in $O(n^{1/3})$ rounds, and provide triangle detection and
4-cycle detection algorithms that complete in $O(n^{\kappa})$ rounds.

detection algorithms improve upon the previously best known algorithms in this

  spread between countries. Validation and application to the 2014-15 Ebola
  Virus Disease epidemic","Ebola virus disease is a lethal human and primate disease that currently
requires a particular attention from the international health authorities due
to important outbreaks in some Western African countries and isolated cases in
the United Kingdom, the USA and Spain. Regarding the emergency of this
situation, there is a need of development of decision tools, such as
mathematical models, to assist the authorities to focus their efforts in
important factors to eradicate Ebola. In this work, we propose a novel
deterministic spatial-temporal model, called Be-CoDiS (Between-Countries
Disease Spread), to study the evolution of human diseases within and between
countries. The main interesting characteristics of Be-CoDiS are the
consideration of the movement of people between countries, the control measure
effects and the use of time dependent coefficients adapted to each country.
First, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model
and explain how its parameters and inputs are obtained. Then, in order to
validate our approach, we consider two numerical experiments regarding the
2014-15 Ebola epidemic. The first one studies the ability of the model in
predicting the EVD evolution between countries starting from the index cases in
Guinea in December 2013. The second one consists of forecasting the evolution
of the epidemic by using some recent data. The results obtained with Be-CoDiS
are compared to real data and other models outputs found in the literature.
Finally, a brief parameter sensitivity analysis is done. A free Matlab version

One of these strings is referred to as a parameter. The problem: given a
propositional logic program P and a non-negative integer k, decide whether P
has a stable model of size no more than k, is an example of a parameterized
decision problem with k serving as a parameter. Parameterized problems that are
NP-complete often become solvable in polynomial time if the parameter is fixed.
The problem to decide whether a program P has a stable model of size no more
than k, where k is fixed and not a part of input, can be solved in time
O(mn^k), where m is the size of P and n is the number of atoms in P. Thus, this
problem is in the class P. However, algorithms with the running time given by a
polynomial of order k are not satisfactory even for relatively small values of
k.
  The key question then is whether significantly better algorithms (with the
degree of the polynomial not dependent on k) exist. To tackle it, we use the
framework of fixed-parameter complexity. We establish the fixed-parameter
complexity for several parameterized decision problems involving models,
supported models and stable models of logic programs. We also establish the
fixed-parameter complexity for variants of these problems resulting from
restricting attention to Horn programs and to purely negative programs. Most of
the problems considered in the paper have high fixed-parameter complexity.

  SAT-Based Planning","In Verification and in (optimal) AI Planning, a successful method is to
formulate the application as boolean satisfiability (SAT), and solve it with
state-of-the-art DPLL-based procedures. There is a lack of understanding of why
this works so well. Focussing on the Planning context, we identify a form of
problem structure concerned with the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the
cost of achieving the individual planning goals. We quantify this sort of
structure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0

Planning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of
SAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted
synthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and
that are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search
space. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure.
The CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the
length of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the
best possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of
structure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of
branching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential
lower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of
variables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations

extreme cases. The reasons for this behavior -- the proof arguments --

goal, there is a recent focus on relaxations of its definition. An approach in
this direction is to complement allocations with payments (or subsidies) to the
agents. A feasible goal then is to achieve envy-freeness in terms of the total

side, we present an algorithm that, for a constant number of agents,
approximates the minimum amount of subsidies within any required accuracy, at

formulation of HSVR, there were no rules for choosing the depth of the model.
In this paper, we observe in a number of models a phase transition in the
training error -- the error remains relatively constant as layers are added,
until a critical scale is passed, at which point the training error drops close
to zero and remains nearly constant for added layers. We introduce a method to
predict this critical scale a priori with the prediction based on the support
of either a Fourier transform of the data or the Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) spectrum. This allows us to determine the required number of layers prior

  interactive data retrieval","There is great interest in supporting imprecise queries (e.g., keyword search
or natural language queries) over databases today. To support such queries, the
database system is typically required to disambiguate parts of the
user-specified query against the database, using whatever resources are
intrinsically available to it (the database schema, data values distributions,
natural language models etc). Often, systems will also have a user-interaction
log available, which can serve as an extrinsic resource to supplement their
model based on their own intrinsic resources. This leads to a problem of how
best to combine the system's prior ranking with insight derived from the
user-interaction log. Statistical inference techniques such as maximum
likelihood or Bayesian updates from a subjective prior turn out not to apply in
a straightforward way due to possible noise from user search behavior and to
encoding biases endemic to the system's models. In this paper, we address such
learning problem in interactive data retrieval, with specific focus on type
classification for user-specified query terms. We develop a novel Bayesian
smoothing algorithm, Bsmooth, which is simple, fast, flexible and accurate. We
analytically establish some desirable properties and show, through experiments

  Defined Enterprise Networks","Enterprise Networks, over the years, have become more and more complex trying
to keep up with new requirements that challenge traditional solutions. Just to
mention one out of many possible examples, technologies such as Virtual LANs
(VLANs) struggle to address the scalability and operational requirements
introduced by Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. To keep up with these
challenges we have identified four main requirements that are common across
modern enterprise networks: (i) scalable mobility, (ii) endpoint segmentation,
(iii) simplified administration, and (iv) resource optimization. To address
these challenges we designed SDA (Software Defined Access), a solution for
modern enterprise networks that leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and
other state of the art techniques. In this paper we present the design,
implementation and evaluation of SDA. Specifically, SDA: (i) leverages a
combination of an overlay approach with an event-driven protocol (LISP) to
dynamically adapt to traffic and mobility patterns while preserving resources,
and (ii) enforces dynamic endpoint groups for scalable segmentation with low
operational burden. We present our experience with deploying SDA in two
real-life scenarios: an enterprise campus, and a large warehouse with mobile
robots. Our evaluation shows that SDA, when compared with traditional
enterprise networks, can (i) reduce overall data plane forwarding state up to
70% thanks to a reactive protocol using a centralized routing server, and (ii)
reduce by an order of magnitude the handover delays in scenarios of massive
mobility with respect to other approaches. Finally, we discuss lessons learned

Operators, which are the building blocks of programs written in PiCo, a DSL for
Data Analytics Pipelines. In the model we propose, we use the term Pipeline to
denote a workflow that processes data collections -- rather than a
computational process -- as is common in the data processing community. The
novelty with respect to other frameworks is that all PiCo operators are
polymorphic with respect to data types. This makes it possible to 1) re-use the
same algorithms and pipelines on different data models (e.g., streams, lists,
sets, etc); 2) reuse the same operators in different contexts, and 3) update
operators without affecting the calling context, i.e., the previous and
following stages in the pipeline. Notice that in other mainstream frameworks,
such as Spark, the update of a pipeline by changing a transformation with
another is not necessarily trivial, since it may require the development of an
input and output proxy to adapt the new transformation for the calling context.
In the same line, we provide a formal framework (i.e., typing and semantics)
that characterizes programs from the perspective of how they transform the data
structures they process -- rather than the computational processes they
represent. This approach allows to reason about programs at an abstract level,

their physical environment in a predictable time. While multicore platforms
provide incredible computational power and throughput, they also introduce new
sources of unpredictability. Large fluctuations in latency to access data
shared between multiple cores is an important contributor to the overall
execution-time variability. In addition to the temporal unpredictability
introduced by caching, parallel applications with data shared across multiple
cores also pay additional latency overheads due to data coherence. Analyzing
the impact of data coherence on the worst-case execution-time of real-time
applications is challenging because only scarce implementation details are
revealed by manufacturers. This paper presents application level control for
caching data at different levels of the cache hierarchy. The rationale is that
by caching data only in shared cache it is possible to bypass private caches.
The access latency to data present in caches becomes independent of its
coherence state. We discuss the existing architectural support as well as the
required hardware and OS modifications to support the proposed cacheability
control. We evaluate the system on an architectural simulator. We show that the
worst case execution time for a single memory write request is reduced by 52%.

challenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN
compression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge
distillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a
novel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and
distillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that
are unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our
distillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation
quality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the
state-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2

passes over each region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.
The constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower
cannot clear the pile.

in which the snow is thrown. We differentiate between the cases in which the
snow can be thrown in any direction, in any direction except backwards, and
only to the right. For all cases, we give constant-factor approximation
algorithms; the constants increase as the throw direction becomes more

resolution refutation system, augmented with the ability to carry out basic
counting. Denoted Res(lin_R), this refutation system operates with disjunctions
of linear equations with boolean variables over a ring R, to refute
unsatisfiable sets of such disjunctions. Beginning in the work of [RT08],
through the work of [IS14] which focused on tree-like lower bounds, this
refutation system was shown to be fairly strong. Subsequent work (cf.[Kra17,

general Res(lin_R) refutations is a challenging and interesting task since the
system captures a 'minimal' extension of resolution with counting gates for
which no super-polynomial lower bounds are known to date.
  We provide the first super-polynomial size lower bounds on general (dag-like)
resolution over linear equations refutations in the large characteristic
regime. In particular we prove that the subset-sum principle 1+x1+...+2^n xn=0
requires refutations of exponential size over Q. Our proof technique is
nontrivial and novel: roughly speaking, we show that under certain conditions
every refutation of a subset-sum instance f=0 must pass through a fat clause
containing an equation f=alpha for each alpha in the image of f under boolean
assignments. We develop a somewhat different approach to prove exponential
lower bounds against tree-like refutations of any subset-sum instance that

self-supervised multimodal methods that combine vision and language were

strictly on the inherent correlation between different modalities. We
demonstrate how our noise estimation can be broadly integrated and achieves

fundamental problem in Linear Programming, Computational Geometry, Machine
Learning and Statistics, it also serves as a query problem in many applications
e.g. Topic Modeling, LP Feasibility, Data Reduction. The {\it Triangle
Algorithm} (TA) \cite{kalantari2015characterization} either computes an
approximate solution in the convex hull, or a separating hyperplane. The {\it
Spherical}-CHM is a CHM, where $p=0$ and each point in $S$ has unit norm.
First, we prove the equivalence of exact and approximate versions of CHM and
Spherical-CHM. On the one hand, this makes it possible to state a simple
version of the original TA. On the other hand, we prove that under the
satisfiability of a simple condition in each iteration, the complexity improves
to $O(1/\varepsilon)$. The analysis also suggests a strategy for when the
property does not hold at an iterate. This suggests the \textit{Spherical-TA}
which first converts a given CHM into a Spherical-CHM before applying the

Full grid interpolation methods suffer from the so-called curse of
dimensionality, rendering them infeasible if the parameter domain of the
function is higher-dimensional (four or more parameters). Sparse grids
constitute a discretization method that drastically eases the curse, while the
approximation quality deteriorates only insignificantly. However, conventional
basis functions such as piecewise linear functions are not smooth (continuously
differentiable). Hence, these basis functions are unsuitable for applications
in which gradients are required. One example for such an application is
gradient-based optimization, in which the availability of gradients greatly
improves the speed of convergence and the accuracy of the results.

size of a customer arriving in stationarity is smaller than exactly k>=0 out of

sojourn time distribution of this newly arriving customer behaves
asymptotically the same as if the customer were served in isolation with a
server of rate (1-\rho)/(k+1) for PS/FBPS, and (1-\rho) for SRPT, respectively,

  Inspired by the preceding results, we propose an approximation to the SRPT

Specifically, if the newly arriving job is smaller than k and larger than m-k

satisfiability of Boolean formulas in CNF form, these are designed primarily
for deciding satisfiability of the formula and do not address the problem of
finding all satisfying solutions. Moreover development of parallel solvers for
satisfiability problems is still an unfinished problem of Computer Science. The
solver proposed in this paper is aimed at representing all solutions of Boolean
formulas even without the CNF form with a parallel algorithm. Algorithm
proposed is applied to Boolean functions in algebraic normal form (ANF). The
algorithm is based on the idea to represent the satisfying assignments in terms
of a complete set of implicants of the Boolean functions appearing as factors
of a Boolean formula. The algorithm is effective mainly in the case when the
factors of the formula are sparse (i.e. have a small fraction of the total
number of variables). This allows small computation of a complete set of
implicants of individual factors one at a time and reduce the formula at each
step. An algorithm is also proposed for finding a complete set of orthogonal
implicants of functions in ANF. An advantages of this algorithm is that all
solutions can be represented compactly in terms of implicants. Finally due to
small and distributed computation at every step as well as computation in terms
of independent threads, the solver proposed in this paper is expected to be

analysis of complex networks. The number of triangles also has important
applications in data mining. Existing distributed memory parallel algorithms
for counting triangles are either Map-Reduce based or message passing interface
(MPI) based and work with overlapping partitions of the given network. These
algorithms are designed for very sparse networks and do not work well when the
degrees of the nodes are relatively larger. For networks with larger degrees,
Map-Reduce based algorithm generates prohibitively large intermediate data, and
in MPI based algorithms with overlapping partitions, each partition can grow as
large as the original network, wiping out the benefit of partitioning the
network.
  In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based parallel algorithms for
counting triangles in massive networks with large degrees. The first algorithm
is a space-efficient algorithm for networks that do not fit in the main memory
of a single compute node. This algorithm divides the network into
non-overlapping partitions. The second algorithm is for the case where the main
memory of each node is large enough to contain the entire network. We observe
that for such a case, computation load can be balanced dynamically and present
a dynamic load balancing scheme which improves the performance significantly.

cerebrovascular condition they order imaging tests. Neuroradiologists visually
search the resulting scans for abnormalities. Their visual search tasks
correspond to the abstract network analysis tasks of browsing and path
following. To assist neuroradiologists in identifying cerebral artery

we contribute a novel framing and definition of the cerebral artery system in
terms of network theory and characterize neuroradiologist domain goals as
abstract visualization and network analysis tasks. Through an iterative,
user-centered design process we developed an abstract network layout technique
which incorporates cerebral artery spatial context. The abstract visualization
enables increased domain task performance over 3D geometry representations,
while including spatial context helps preserve the user's mental map of the
underlying geometry. We provide open source implementations of our network

demonstrate the robustness of our technique by successfully laying out 61 open

  Utility Clustering","Dynamic replication is a wide-spread multi-copy routing approach for
efficiently coping with the intermittent connectivity in mobile opportunistic
networks. According to it, a node forwards a message replica to an encountered
node based on a utility value that captures the latter's fitness for delivering
the message to the destination. The popularity of the approach stems from its
flexibility to effectively operate in networks with diverse characteristics
without requiring special customization. Nonetheless, its drawback is the
tendency to produce a high number of replicas that consume limited resources
such as energy and storage. To tackle the problem we make the observation that
network nodes can be grouped, based on their utility values, into clusters that
portray different delivery capabilities. We exploit this finding to transform
the basic forwarding strategy, which is to move a packet using nodes of
increasing utility, and actually forward it through clusters of increasing
delivery capability. The new strategy works in synergy with the basic dynamic
replication algorithms and is fully configurable, in the sense that it can be
used with virtually any utility function. We also extend our approach to work
with two utility functions at the same time, a feature that is especially
efficient in mobile networks that exhibit social characteristics. By conducting
experiments in a wide set of real-life networks, we empirically show that our

interpreted as a weak metric over the data. By introducing randomness during
hierarchy training and combining the output of many of the resulting

semi-supervised, incorporating information from both constrained and
unconstrained points. Second, we take a relaxed approach to constraint
satisfaction, allowing the method to satisfy different subsets of the
constraints at different levels of the hierarchy rather than attempting to
simultaneously satisfy all of them. This leads to a more robust learning
algorithm. We compare our method to a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks on

Many techniques can transform the data in order to find better features, but

the generated variables. This leads to three different new feature learners,
Scorer, Skaler and Slicer. They are based on Fisher's discriminant ratio, the

first sorting the client connection costs and then multiplying them with a
predefined non-increasing weight vector (higher connection costs are taken with
larger weights). Since the 1990s, this problem has been studied extensively in
the discrete optimization and operations research communities and has emerged
as a framework unifying many fundamental clustering and location problems such
as k-Median and k-Center. This generality, however, renders the problem
intriguing from the algorithmic perspective and obtaining non-trivial
approximation algorithms was an open problem even for simple topologies such as
trees. Recently, Aouad and Segev were able to obtain an O(log n) approximation
algorithm for Ordered k-Median using a sophisticated local-search approach and
the concept of surrogate models thereby extending the result by Tamir (2001)
for the case of a rectangular weight vector, also known as k-Facility
p-Centrum.

(2012) for k-Median, when applied to a fractional solution obtained from
solving an LP relaxation over a non-metric, truncated cost vector, resulting in
an elegant 15-approximation for the rectangular case. Then, we show that a
simple weight bucketing can be applied to the general case resulting in O(log
n) rectangles and hence in a constant-factor approximation in quasi-polynomial

probably most well-known problem if this type is knapsack and many
generalizations of it have been studied in the literature like Two-dimensional
Geometric Knapsack (2DKP) and Unsplittable Flow on a Path (UFP). For the latter
two problems, recently the first polynomial time approximation algorithms with
better approximation ratios than 2 were presented [G\'alvez et al., FOCS
2017][Grandoni et al., STOC 2018].
  In this paper we break the barrier of 2 for the Storage Allocation Problem
(SAP) which is a natural intermediate problem between 2DKP and UFP. We are
given a path with capacitated edges and a set of tasks where each task has a
start vertex, an end vertex, a size, and a profit. We seek to select the most
profitable set of tasks that we can draw as non-overlapping rectangles
underneath the capacity profile of the edges where the height of each rectangle
equals the size of the corresponding task.
  This problem is motivated by settings of allocation resources like memory,
bandwidths, etc. where each request needs a contiguous portion of the resource.
The best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for SAP has an
approximation ratio of 2+epsilon$ [M\""omke and Wiese, ICALP 2015] and no better
quasi-polynomial time algorithm is known. We present a polynomial time (63/32)
< 1.969-approximation algorithm for the case of uniform edge capacities and a
quasi-polynomial time (1.997)-approximation algorithm for non-uniform

Core, IG Extended, IG Logico). In addition to the encoding of regulative
statements, it further introduces the encoding of constitutive institutional
statements, as well as statements that exhibit both constitutive and regulative
characteristics. Introducing those aspects, the codebook initially covers
fundamental concepts of IG 2.0, before providing an overview of pre-coding

notably in Taxonomy such tree structures have been studied using ultrametrics.
Here syntactical hierarchical phrase trees are subject to a similar analysis,
which is much siompler as the branching structure is more readily discernible
and switched. The occurence of hierarchical structure elsewhere in linguistics
is mentioned. The phrase tree can be represented by a matrix and the elements
of the matrix can be represented by triangles. The height at which branching
occurs is not prescribed in previous syntatic models, but it is by using the
ultrametric matrix. The ambiguity of which branching height to choose is
resolved by postulating that branching occurs at the lowest height available.
An ultrametric produces a measure of the complexity of sentences: presumably
the complexity of sentence increases as a language is aquired so that this can
be tested. A All ultrametric triangles are equilateral or isocles, here it is
shown that X structur implies that there are no equilateral triangles.

players can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to obtain higher worths
than by acting in isolation. A fundamental problem for coalitional games is to
single out the most desirable outcomes in terms of appropriate notions of worth
distributions, which are usually called solution concepts. Motivated by the
fact that decisions taken by realistic players cannot involve unbounded
resources, recent computer science literature reconsidered the definition of
such concepts by advocating the relevance of assessing the amount of resources
needed for their computation in terms of their computational complexity. By
following this avenue of research, the paper provides a complete picture of the
complexity issues arising with three prominent solution concepts for
coalitional games with transferable utility, namely, the core, the kernel, and
the bargaining set, whenever the game worth-function is represented in some
reasonable compact form (otherwise, if the worths of all coalitions are

in Prolog. Two ways have been explored to resolve these problems: loop checking
and tabling. Loop checking can cut infinite loops, but it cannot be both sound
and complete even for function-free logic programs. Tabling seems to be an
effective way to resolve infinite loops and redundant computations. However,
existing tabulated resolutions, such as OLDT-resolution, SLG- resolution, and
Tabulated SLS-resolution, are non-linear because they rely on the
solution-lookup mode in formulating tabling. The principal disadvantage of
non-linear resolutions is that they cannot be implemented using a simple
stack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. Moreover, some strictly
sequential operators such as cuts may not be handled as easily as in Prolog.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to resolve infinite loops and
redundant computations. We combine the ideas of loop checking and tabling to
establish a linear tabulated resolution called TP-resolution. TP-resolution has
two distinctive features: (1) It makes linear tabulated derivations in the same
way as Prolog except that infinite loops are broken and redundant computations
are reduced. It handles cuts as effectively as Prolog. (2) It is sound and
complete for positive logic programs with the bounded-term-size property. The

the same level of accuracy that would be obtained with online micro-macro

we provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability status of
Panopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic, definitions.

  Applications","The accuracy of machine learning systems is a widely studied research topic.
Established techniques such as cross-validation predict the accuracy on unseen
data of the classifier produced by applying a given learning method to a given
training data set. However, they do not predict whether incurring the cost of
obtaining more data and undergoing further training will lead to higher
accuracy. In this paper we investigate techniques for making such early
predictions. We note that when a machine learning algorithm is presented with a
training set the classifier produced, and hence its error, will depend on the
characteristics of the algorithm, on training set's size, and also on its
specific composition. In particular we hypothesise that if a number of
classifiers are produced, and their observed error is decomposed into bias and
variance terms, then although these components may behave differently, their
behaviour may be predictable.
  We test our hypothesis by building models that, given a measurement taken
from the classifier created from a limited number of samples, predict the
values that would be measured from the classifier produced when the full data
set is presented. We create separate models for bias, variance and total error.
Our models are built from the results of applying ten different machine
learning algorithms to a range of data sets, and tested with ""unseen""
algorithms and datasets. We analyse the results for various numbers of initial
training samples, and total dataset sizes. Results show that our predictions
are very highly correlated with the values observed after undertaking the extra

http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08884v1,On the best choice of Lasso program given data parameters,"Generalized compressed sensing (GCS) is a paradigm in which a structured
high-dimensional signal may be recovered from random, under-determined, and
corrupted linear measurements. Generalized Lasso (GL) programs are effective
for solving GCS problems due to their proven ability to leverage underlying
signal structure. Three popular GL programs are equivalent in a sense and
sometimes used interchangeably. Tuned by a governing parameter, each admit an
optimal parameter choice. For sparse or low-rank signal structures, this choice
yields minimax order-optimal error. While GCS is well-studied, existing theory
for GL programs typically concerns this optimally tuned setting. However, the
optimal parameter value for a GL program depends on properties of the data, and
is typically unknown in practical settings. Performance in empirical problems
thus hinges on a program's parameter sensitivity: it is desirable that small
variation about the optimal parameter choice begets small variation about the
optimal risk. We examine the risk for these three programs and demonstrate that
their parameter sensitivity can differ for the same data. We prove a
gauge-constrained GL program admits asymptotic cusp-like behaviour of its risk
in the limiting low-noise regime. We prove that a residual-constrained Lasso
program has asymptotically suboptimal risk for very sparse vectors. These
results contrast observations about an unconstrained Lasso program, which is
relatively less sensitive to its parameter choice. We support the asymptotic
theory with numerical simulations, demonstrating that parameter sensitivity of
GL programs is readily observed for even modest dimensional parameters.
Importantly, these simulations demonstrate regimes in which a GL program
exhibits sensitivity to its parameter choice, though the other two do not. We
hope this work aids practitioners in selecting a GL program for their problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

one vertex at each step while maintaining a proper coloring at any step?
Cereceda et al. answered that question in the affirmative, and exhibited a
recolouring sequence of exponential length. However, Cereceda conjectured that
there should exist one of quadratic length.
  The $k$-reconfiguration graph of $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the
proper $k$-colourings of $G$, with an edge between two colourings if they
differ on exactly one vertex. Cereceda's conjecture can be reformulated as
follows: the diameter of the $(d+2)$-reconfiguration graph of any
$d$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices is $O(n^2)$. So far, the existence of a
polynomial diameter is open even for $d=2$.
  In this paper, we prove that the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph of
a $d$-degenerate graph is $O(n^{d+1})$ for $k \ge d+2$. Moreover, we prove that
if $k \ge \frac 32 (d+1)$ then the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph is

experiential learning; and a high level of control over the training, in that

However, VEs are typically presented as audiovisual (AV) systems, whereas
engagement of other senses could increase the immersion in the virtual
experience. Moreover, other senses play a key role in certain health and safety
contexts, for example the feel of heat and smell in a fire or smell in a fuel
leak. A multisensory (MS) VE was developed, which provided simulated heat and
smell in accordance with events in a virtual world. As users approached a
virtual fire, they felt heat from three 2 kW heaters and smelled smoke from a
scent diffuser. Behaviours in the MS VE demonstrated higher validity than those
in a comparable AV VE, which ratings and verbatim responses indicated was down
to a greater belief that participants were in a real fire. However, a study of
the effectiveness of the MS VE as a training tool demonstrated that it did not
offer benefits over AV as measured by a written knowledge test and subjective
ratings of engagement, attitude towards health and safety and desire to repeat.
However, the study found further evidence for the use of AV VEs in health and
safety training, particularly as the subjective ratings were generally better

be costly. Centrally managed supply chains invest in ensuring their resilience.
Decentralized supply chains, however, must rely upon the self-interest of their
individual components to maintain the resilience of the entire chain.
  We examine the incentives that independent self-interested agents have in
forming a resilient supply chain network in the face of production disruptions
and competition. In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield
uncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time
uncertainty or, ""soft"" supply caps). Competing retailers must decide which
suppliers to link to based on both price and reliability. In the presence of
yield uncertainty only, the resulting supply chain networks are sparse.
Retailers concentrate their links on a single supplier, counter to the idea
that they should mitigate yield uncertainty by diversifying their supply base.
This happens because retailers benefit from supply variance. It suggests that
competition will amplify output uncertainty. When congestion is included as
well, the resulting networks are denser and resemble the bipartite expander
graphs that have been proposed in the supply chain literature, thereby,
providing the first example of endogenous formation of resilient supply chain
networks, without resilience being explicitly encoded in payoffs. Finally, we
show that a supplier's investments in improved yield can make it worse off.

large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in resource constrained devices. In this
work, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the
structures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs.
SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation
cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently
accelerate the DNNs evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on
average 5.1x and 3.1x speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet
against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups
are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN
structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for
CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth can reduce 20 layers of a Deep Residual
Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improve the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%,
which is still slightly higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For

  Fixed-Parameter Tractable","Lubiw showed that several variants of Graph Isomorphism are NP-complete,
where the solutions are required to satisfy certain additional constraints
[SICOMP 10, 1981]. One of these, called Isomorphism With Restrictions, is to
decide for two given graphs $X_1=(V,E_1)$ and $X_2=(V,E_2)$ and a subset
$R\subseteq V\times V$ of forbidden pairs whether there is an isomorphism $\pi$
from $X_1$ to $X_2$ such that $\pi(i)\neq j$ for all $(i,j)\in R$. We prove
that this problem and several of its generalizations are in fact in FPT:
  - The problem of deciding whether there is an isomorphism between two graphs
that moves k vertices and satisfies Lubiw-style constraints is in FPT, with k
and the size of $R$ as parameters. The problem remains in FPT if a CNF of such
constraints is allowed. It follows that the problem to decide whether there is
an isomorphism that moves exactly k vertices is in FPT. This solves a question
left open in our article on exact weight automorphisms [STACS 2017].
  - When the weight and complexity are unrestricted, finding isomorphisms that
satisfy a CNF of Lubiw-style constraints can be solved in FPT with access to a
GI oracle.
  - Checking if there is an isomorphism $\pi$ between two graphs with
complexity t is also in FPT with t as parameter, where the complexity of a
permutation is the Cayley measure defined as the minimum number t such that
$\pi$ can be expressed as a product of t transpositions.
  - We consider a more general problem in which the vertex set of a graph X is
partitioned into Red and Blue, and we are interested in an automorphism that
stabilizes Red and Blue and moves exactly k vertices in Blue, where k is the
parameter. This problem was introduced by [Downey and Fellows 1999], and we

that both mixture models achieve better performance than a non-Bayesian mixture
model. The variational algorithm is the faster of the two approaches while the
Gibbs sampling method achieves a more accurate results. The Dirichlet process
mixture model can automatically grow to a proper complexity for a better
approximation. Once the model is built, it can be very fast to query and run
analysis on (typically 10 times faster than Eclat, as we will show in the

expand logic programming languages to handle incomplete information. One such
language is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic
programming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the
general case. For extended disjunctive logic programs, an idea that has proven
useful in simplifying the investigation of answer sets is the use of splitting
sets. In this paper we will present an extended definition of splitting sets
that will be applicable to epistemic specifications. Furthermore, an extension
of the splitting set theorem will be presented. Also, a characterization of
stratified epistemic specifications will be given in terms of splitting sets.

  Distributed Networks","In this paper, we propose a simple randomized protocol for identifying
trusted nodes based on personalized trust in large scale distributed networks.
The problem of identifying trusted nodes, based on personalized trust, in a
large network setting stems from the huge computation and message overhead
involved in exhaustively calculating and propagating the trust estimates by the
remote nodes. However, in any practical scenario, nodes generally communicate
with a small subset of nodes and thus exhaustively estimating the trust of all
the nodes can lead to huge resource consumption. In contrast, our mechanism can
be tuned to locate a desired subset of trusted nodes, based on the allowable
overhead, with respect to a particular user. The mechanism is based on a simple
exchange of random walk messages and nodes counting the number of times they
are being hit by random walkers of nodes in their neighborhood. Simulation
results to analyze the effectiveness of the algorithm show that using the
proposed algorithm, nodes identify the top trusted nodes in the network with a
very high probability by exploring only around 45% of the total nodes, and in
turn generates nearly 90% less overhead as compared to an exhaustive trust
estimation mechanism, named TrustWebRank. Finally, we provide a measure of the
global trustworthiness of a node; simulation results indicate that the measures
generated using our mechanism differ by only around 0.6% as compared to
TrustWebRank.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0203005v2,A Framework for Compiling Preferences in Logic Programs,"We introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference
information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered
logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique
terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form
s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a
second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected,
in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the
preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the
specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily
within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a
logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we
develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the
preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We
then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing
how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured
within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an
extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as
dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler

  Solution Bounds","Given a formula in quantifier-free Presburger arithmetic, if it has a
satisfying solution, there is one whose size, measured in bits, is polynomially
bounded in the size of the formula. In this paper, we consider a special class
of quantifier-free Presburger formulas in which most linear constraints are
difference (separation) constraints, and the non-difference constraints are
sparse. This class has been observed to commonly occur in software
verification. We derive a new solution bound in terms of parameters
characterizing the sparseness of linear constraints and the number of
non-difference constraints, in addition to traditional measures of formula
size. In particular, we show that the number of bits needed per integer
variable is linear in the number of non-difference constraints and logarithmic
in the number and size of non-zero coefficients in them, but is otherwise
independent of the total number of linear constraints in the formula. The
derived bound can be used in a decision procedure based on instantiating
integer variables over a finite domain and translating the input
quantifier-free Presburger formula to an equi-satisfiable Boolean formula,
which is then checked using a Boolean satisfiability solver. In addition to our

dynamics of networks of neurons rather than on single neurons. On the other
hand, the network dynamics reflect and arise from the integration and
coordination of the activity of populations of single neurons. Understanding
how single-neurons and neural-circuits dynamics complement each other to
produce brain functions is thus of paramount importance. LFPs and EEGs are good
indicators of the dynamics of mesoscopic and macroscopic populations of
neurons, while microscopic-level activities can be documented by measuring the
membrane potential, the synaptic currents or the spiking activity of individual
neurons. In this thesis we develop mathematical modelling and mathematical
analysis tools that can help the interpretation of joint measures of neural
activity at microscopic and mesoscopic or macroscopic scales. In particular, we
develop network models of recurrent cortical circuits that can clarify the
impact of several aspects of single-neuron (i.e., microscopic-level) dynamics
on the activity of the whole neural population (as measured by LFP). We then
develop statistical tools to characterize the relationship between the action
potential firing of single neurons and mass signals. We apply these latter
analysis techniques to joint recordings of the firing activity of individual
cell-type identified neurons and mesoscopic (i.e., LFP) and macroscopic (i.e.,

learning applications. It separates the specification of application logic (in
a dataflow graph) from the execution of the logic. TensorFlow's native runtime
executes the application with low overhead across a diverse set of hardware
including CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs. Although the underlying dataflow engine
supporting these features could be applied to computations beyond machine
learning, certain design decisions limit this broader application, such as the
inability for an application to differentiate between data items across
concurrent requests.
  This paper introduces Pipelined TensorFlow (PTF), a system that extends
TensorFlow's semantics to provide support for a broader variety of application
logic. In particular, PTF supports applications that concurrently process
finite batches of data on a single instantiation. PTF adds these semantics by
partitioning the dataflow graph into a pipeline of smaller graphs and tagging
each data item with metadata. These smaller graphs are separated by gates: new
data structures in PTF that buffer data items between graphs and interpret the
metadata to apply the new semantics. PTF's pipeline architecture executes on an
unmodified TensorFlow runtime, maintaining compatibility with many existing
TensorFlow library functions. Our evaluation shows that the pipelining
mechanism of PTF can increase the throughput of a bioinformatics application by

  of Verhulst et al. 2018 version 1.2","This document describes a comprehensive procedure of how the biophysical
model published by Verhulst et al. (2018) can be calibrated on the basis of
reference auditory brainstem responses. Additionally, the filter design used in
two of the model stages, cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC), is
described in detail. These descriptions are valid for a new release of the
Verhulst et al. model, version 1.2, as well as for previous versions of the
model (version 1.1 or earlier). The differences between the model versions are
explicitly mentioned and simulations to basic auditory stimuli are shown for
model versions 1.1 and 1.2. In short, version 1.2 of the model includes a new
implementation of the CN and IC stages (Stages 5 and 6). All previous model
stages (Stages 1-4: outer and middle ear, transmission-line cochlear filter
bank, inner hair cell model, and auditory nerve model) remained unchanged. In
the new release (model version 1.2), in addition to the updated CN and IC
stages, we employed a different calibration procedure to match human reference
ABR amplitudes of waves I, III, and V more faithfully. This release note shows
the implications of these model adjustments on the simulations presented in the
original 2018 model paper. For this purpose, results from two model versions
are reported: (1) New model release (version 1.2), labelled as model v1.2; and
(2) Previous model release as used by Verhulst et al., labelled as model v1.1.
The main difference between IC model stages relates to the degree of IC
inhibition that was applied, with more inhibition in v1.2 than implemented in
v1.1. The time domain simulations presented in this document show that this
change in inhibition strength does not drastically change the results presented
in the original paper. However, v1.2 more correctly captures the

by the first author in the case of a binary alphabet $A$, and later extended by
other authors to arbitrary alphabets. Acting on infinite words, $\psi$
generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard
Arnoux-Rauzy words. In this paper we generalize the palindromization map,
starting with a given code $X$ over $A$. The new map $\psi_X$ maps $X^*$ to the
set $PAL$ of palindromes of $A^*$. In this way some properties of $\psi$ are
lost and some are saved in a weak form. When $X$ has a finite deciphering delay
one can extend $\psi_X$ to $X^{\omega}$, generating a class of infinite words
much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code $X$
over $A$, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words,
called $X$-AR words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a
standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and
upper bounds to its factor complexity.

$\psi_X(X^{*})\subseteq X^{*}$. We study conservative maps $\psi_X$ and
conditions on $X$ assuring that $\psi_X$ is conservative. We also investigate

After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral

Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD
signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter
banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to detect the presence or
absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a

data with privacy"". In this respect, the concept of privacy by design is key to
identify the privacy requirements early in the big data analytics value chain
and in subsequently implementing the necessary technical and organizational
measures.
  After an analysis of the proposed privacy by design strategies in the
different phases of the big data value chain, we review privacy enhancing
technologies of special interest for the current and future big data landscape.
In particular, we discuss anonymization, the ""traditional"" analytics technique,
the emerging area of encrypted search and privacy preserving computations,
granular access control mechanisms, policy enforcement and accountability, as
well as data provenance issues. Moreover, new transparency and access tools in
big data are explored, together with techniques for user empowerment and
control.
  Achieving ""big data with privacy"" is no easy task and a lot of research and
implementation is still needed. Yet, it remains a possible task, as long as all
the involved stakeholders take the necessary steps to integrate privacy and
data protection safeguards in the heart of big data, by design and by default.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

  Wireless Networks of Smart-Phones","We consider the problem of detecting clones in wireless mobile adhoc
networks. We assume that one of the devices of the network has been cloned.
Everything, including certificates and secret keys. This can happen quite
easily, because of a virus that immediately after sending all the content of
the infected device to the adversary destroys itself, or just because the owner
has left his device unattended for a few minutes in a hostile environment. The
problem is to detect this attack. We propose a solution in networks of mobile
devices carried by individuals. These networks are composed by nodes that have
the capability of using short-range communication technology like blue-tooth or
Wi-Fi, where nodes are carried by mobile users, and where links appear and
disappear according to the social relationships between the users. Our idea is
to use social physical contacts, securely collected by wireless personal
smart-phones, as a biometric way to authenticate the legitimate owner of the
device and detect the clone attack. We introduce two mechanisms: Personal Marks
and Community Certificates. Personal Marks is a simple cryptographic protocol
that works very well when the adversary is an insider, a malicious node in the
network that is part, or not very far, from the social community of the
original device that has been cloned. Community Certificates work very well
when the adversary is an outsider, a node that has the goal of using the stolen
credentials when interacting with other nodes that are far in the social
network from the original device. When combined, these mechanisms provide an

of $\mathrm{DT}(P)$ being {\it stable}. Defined in terms of a parameter
$\alpha>0$, a Delaunay edge $pq$ is called $\alpha$-stable, if the (equal)
angles at which $p$ and $q$ see the corresponding Voronoi edge $e_{pq}$ are at
least $\alpha$. A subgraph $G$ of $\mathrm{DT}(P)$ is called {\it $(c\alpha,

\ge 1$, if every edge in $G$ is $\alpha$-stable and every $c\alpha$-stable of
$\mathrm{DT}(P)$ is in $G$.
  We show that if an edge is stable in the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of
$P$, then it is also a stable edge, though for a different value of $\alpha$,
in the Delaunay triangulation of $P$ under any convex distance function that is
sufficiently close to the Euclidean norm, and vice-versa. In particular, a
$6\alpha$-stable edge in $\mathrm{DT}(P)$ is $\alpha$-stable in the Delaunay
triangulation under the distance function induced by a regular $k$-gon for $k
\ge 2\pi/\alpha$, and vice-versa. Exploiting this relationship and the analysis

the points move along algebraic trajectories of bounded degree, the KDS
processes nearly quadratic events during the motion, each of which can

and 1993-in combinatorial game theory (CGT).
  We prove that the Grundy value (a.k.a. nim-value, or nimber) of Undirected
Geography is PSPACE-complete to compute. This exhibits a stark contrast with a
result from 1993 that Undirected Geography is polynomial-time solvable. By
distilling to a simple reduction, our proof further establishes a dichotomy
theorem, providing a ""phase transition to intractability"" in Grundy-value
computation, sharply characterized by a maximum degree of four: The Grundy
value of Undirected Geography over any degree-three graph is polynomial-time
computable, but over degree-four graphs-even when planar and bipartite-is
PSPACE-hard. Additionally, we show, for the first time, how to construct
Undirected Geography instances with Grundy value $\ast n$ and size polynomial
in n.
  We strengthen a result from 1981 showing that sums of tractable partisan
games are PSPACE-complete in two fundamental ways. First, since Undirected
Geography is an impartial ruleset, we extend the hardness of sums to impartial
games, a strict subset of partisan. Second, the 1981 construction is not built
from a natural ruleset, instead using a long sum of tailored short-depth game
positions. We use the sum of two Undirected Geography positions to create our
hard instances. Our result also has computational implications to
Sprague-Grundy Theory (1930s) which shows that the Grundy value of the
disjunctive sum of any two impartial games can be computed-in polynomial

data privacy and on-device learning over networks, as well as for efficient
scaling to large compute clusters. As current approaches suffer from limited
bandwidth of the network, we propose the use of communication compression in
the decentralized training context. We show that Choco-SGD $-$ recently
introduced and analyzed for strongly-convex objectives only $-$ converges under
arbitrary high compression ratio on general non-convex functions at the rate
$O\bigl(1/\sqrt{nT}\bigr)$ where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $n$
the number of workers. The algorithm achieves linear speedup in the number of
workers and supports higher compression than previous state-of-the art methods.

problems, which is related to contention resolution schemes, a technique
initially introduced in the context of submodular function maximization. Our
rounding technique, which we call online contention resolution schemes (OCRSs),
is applicable to many online selection problems, including Bayesian online
selection, oblivious posted pricing mechanisms, and stochastic probing models.
It allows for handling a wide set of constraints, and shares many strong
properties of offline contention resolution schemes. In particular, OCRSs for
different constraint families can be combined to obtain an OCRS for their
intersection. Moreover, we can approximately maximize submodular functions in
the online settings we consider.
  We, thus, get a broadly applicable framework for several online selection
problems, which improves on previous approaches in terms of the types of
constraints that can be handled, the objective functions that can be dealt
with, and the assumptions on the strength of the adversary. Furthermore, we
resolve two open problems from the literature; namely, we present the first
constant-factor constrained oblivious posted price mechanism for matroid

  Solution of Automata","We consider a solution of automata similar to Population Protocols and
Network Constructors. The automata (or nodes) move passively in a well-mixed
solution and can cooperate by interacting in pairs. Every such interaction may
result in an update of the local states of the nodes. Additionally, the nodes
may also choose to connect to each other in order to start forming some
required structure. We may think of such nodes as the smallest possible
programmable pieces of matter. The model that we introduce here is a more
applied version of Network Constructors, imposing physical (or geometrical)
constraints on the connections. Each node can connect to other nodes only via a
very limited number of local ports, therefore at any given time it has only a
bounded number of neighbors. Connections are always made at unit distance and
are perpendicular to connections of neighboring ports. We show that this
restricted model is still capable of forming very practical 2D or 3D shapes. We
provide direct constructors for some basic shape construction problems. We then
develop new techniques for determining the constructive capabilities of our
model. One of the main novelties of our approach, concerns our attempt to
overcome the inability of such systems to detect termination. In particular, we
exploit the assumptions that the system is well-mixed and has a unique leader,
in order to give terminating protocols that are correct with high probability
(w.h.p.). This allows us to develop terminating subroutines that can be
sequentially composed to form larger modular protocols. One of our main results
is a terminating protocol counting the size $n$ of the system w.h.p.. We then
use this protocol as a subroutine in order to develop our universal
constructors, establishing that the nodes can self-organize w.h.p. into

error in a noisy communication network of $N$ randomly placed sensors, each
having one input bit and communicating with others using local transmissions
with power near the connectivity threshold. This result settles the lower bound
question left open by Ying, Srikant and Dullerud (WiOpt 06), who showed how the
sum of all the $N$ bits can be computed using $O(N \log\log N)$ transmissions.
The same lower bound has been shown to hold for a host of other functions
including majority by Dutta and Radhakrishnan (FOCS 2008).
  Most works on lower bounds for communication networks considered mostly the
full broadcast model without using the fact that the communication in real
networks is local, determined by the power of the transmitters. In fact, in
full broadcast networks computing parity needs $\theta(N)$ transmissions. To
obtain our lower bound we employ techniques developed by Goyal, Kindler and
Saks (FOCS 05), who showed lower bounds in the full broadcast model by reducing
the problem to a model of noisy decision trees. However, in order to capture
the limited range of transmissions in real sensor networks, we adapt their
definition of noisy decision trees and allow each node of the tree access to
only a limited part of the input. Our lower bound is obtained by exploiting

  approach","Counting objects is a fundamental but challenging problem. In this paper, we
propose diffusion-based, geometry-free, and learning-free methodologies to
count the number of objects in images. The main idea is to represent each
object by a unique index value regardless of its intensity or size, and to
simply count the number of index values. First, we place different vectors,
refer to as seed vectors, uniformly throughout the mask image. The mask image
has boundary information of the objects to be counted. Secondly, the seeds are
diffused using an edge-weighted harmonic variational optimization model within
each object. We propose an efficient algorithm based on an operator splitting
approach and alternating direction minimization method, and theoretical
analysis of this algorithm is given. An optimal solution of the model is
obtained when the distributed seeds are completely diffused such that there is
a unique intensity within each object, which we refer to as an index. For
computational efficiency, we stop the diffusion process before a full
convergence, and propose to cluster these diffused index values. We refer to
this approach as Counting Objects by Diffused Index (CODI). We explore scalar
and multi-dimensional seed vectors. For Scalar seeds, we use Gaussian fitting
in histogram to count, while for vector seeds, we exploit a high-dimensional
clustering method for the final step of counting via clustering. The proposed

multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems are based on sphere-decoding (SD). The
conventional (and optimum) norm that is used to conduct the tree traversal step
in SD is the l-2 norm. It was, however, recently observed that using the
l-infinity norm instead reduces the hardware complexity of SD considerably at
only a marginal performance loss. These savings result from a reduction in the
length of the critical path in the circuit and the silicon area required for
metric computation, but are also, as observed previously through simulation
results, a consequence of a reduction in the computational (i.e., algorithmic)
complexity. The aim of this paper is an analytical performance and
computational complexity analysis of l-infinity norm SD. For i.i.d. Rayleigh
fading MIMO channels, we show that l-infinity norm SD achieves full diversity
order with an asymptotic SNR gap, compared to l-2 norm SD, that increases at
most linearly in the number of receive antennas. Moreover, we provide a

To help users catch up with the latest topics of their interests from the large

given the topic or event of interest, this framework can dynamically discover

provided by the user, which matches the real scenarios of users searching for
information about an ongoing event. We experimented on two real events traced
by a Twitter dataset from TREC 2011. The results verified the effectiveness of
relevant content filtering and sequential summary generation of the proposed
framework. It also shows its robustness of using the most easy-to-obtain weak
supervision, i.e., trending topic or hashtag. Thus, this framework can be

incredible capabilities to autonomously (i.e., with minimal or no human input)
produce creative products that would ordinarily deserve intellectual property
status if created by a human. These systems could be called artificial creators
and their creative products artificial creations. The use of artificial
creators is likely to become a part of mainstream production practices in the
creative and innovation industries sooner than we realize. When they do,
intellectual property regimes (that are inherently designed to reward human
creativity) must be sufficiently prepared to aptly respond to the phenomenon of
what could be called artificial creativity. Needless to say, any such response
must be guided by considerations of public welfare. This study analyzes what
that response ought to look like by revisiting the determinants of intellectual
property and critiquing its nature and modes. This understanding of
intellectual property is then applied to investigate the determinants of
intellectual property in artificial creations so as to determine the intrinsic
justifications for intellectual property rewards for artificial creativity, and
accordingly, develop general modalities for granting intellectual property
status to artificial creations. Finally, the treatment of artificial works
(i.e., copyrightable artificial creations) and artificial inventions (i.e.,
patentable artificial creations) by current intellectual property regimes is
critiqued, and specific modalities for granting intellectual property status to
artificial works and artificial inventions are developed.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Previously, the best known algorithm for this problem was a

technique (Feldman et al., 2018). For the special case of this problem in which
the objective function is also monotone, the state-of-the-art semi-streaming

different technique (Badanidiyuru, 2014). Adapting the technique of
Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective functions has turned out to be a
challenging task, which has so far prevented an improvement over the local
search based $5.828$-approximation. In this work, we overcome the above
challenge, and manage to adapt Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective
functions by introducing a ""just right"" amount of randomness into it.
Consequently, we get a semi-streaming polynomial time $4.282$-approximation

faster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an

this result by proving that, in a broader setting, the Bayes optimal fair

justification to the post-processing approach in fair classification, in which

  Prediction for Concurrent GPGPU Kernels","Recent NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can execute multiple kernels
concurrently. On these GPUs, the thread block scheduler (TBS) uses the FIFO
policy to schedule their thread blocks. We show that FIFO leaves performance to
chance, resulting in significant loss of performance and fairness. To improve
performance and fairness, we propose use of the preemptive Shortest Remaining
Time First (SRTF) policy instead. Although SRTF requires an estimate of runtime
of GPU kernels, we show that such an estimate of the runtime can be easily
obtained using online profiling and exploiting a simple observation on GPU
kernels' grid structure. Specifically, we propose a novel Structural Runtime
Predictor. Using a simple Staircase model of GPU kernel execution, we show that
the runtime of a kernel can be predicted by profiling only the first few thread
blocks. We evaluate an online predictor based on this model on benchmarks from
ERCBench, and find that it can estimate the actual runtime reasonably well
after the execution of only a single thread block. Next, we design a thread
block scheduler that is both concurrent kernel-aware and uses this predictor.
We implement the SRTF policy and evaluate it on two-program workloads from
ERCBench. SRTF improves STP by 1.18x and ANTT by 2.25x over FIFO. When compared
to MPMax, a state-of-the-art resource allocation policy for concurrent kernels,
SRTF improves STP by 1.16x and ANTT by 1.3x. To improve fairness, we also
propose SRTF/Adaptive which controls resource usage of concurrently executing
kernels to maximize fairness. SRTF/Adaptive improves STP by 1.12x, ANTT by
2.23x and Fairness by 2.95x compared to FIFO. Overall, our implementation of
SRTF achieves system throughput to within 12.64% of Shortest Job First (SJF, an

of the model is conducted using behavioral data collected through human-subject
experiments, and three feedback control policies are experimentally validated
and compared against a non-adaptive decision-aid system. The results show that
human-automation team performance can be optimized when the transparency is

shared feature extractor that extracts global features from each input point
set in parallel and a prediction network that aggregates and reasons on these

for computing a feature vector for the symbol. This signature corresponds to

emerge in the top algorithms, such as bilinear interactions, normalized

module is to a large degree a manual task. Automating this process could
increase the use of static architecture conformance checking methods, such as
reflexion modeling, in industry. Current techniques rely on user
parameterization and a highly cohesive design. A machine learning approach
would potentially require fewer parameters and better use of the available
information to aid in automatic mapping. Aim: We investigate how a classifier
can be trained to map from source code to architecture modules automatically.
This classifier is trained with semantic and syntactic dependency information
extracted from the source code and from architecture descriptions. The
classifier is implemented using multinomial naive Bayes and evaluated. Method:
We perform experiments and compare the classifier with three state-of-the-art
mapping functions in eight open-source Java systems with known
ground-truth-mappings. Results: We find that the classifier outperforms the
state-of-the-art in all cases and that it provides a useful baseline for
further research in the area of semi-automatic incremental clustering.

  Path","In this paper we address the problem of computing a sparse subgraph of a
weighted directed graph such that the exact distances from a designated source
vertex to all other vertices are preserved under bounded weight increment.
Finding a small sized subgraph that preserves distances between any pair of
vertices is a well studied problem. Since in the real world any network is
prone to failures, it is natural to study the fault tolerant version of the
above problem. Unfortunately, it turns out that there may not always exist such
a sparse subgraph even under single edge failure [Demetrescu \emph{et al.}
'08]. However in real applications it is not always the case that a link (edge)
in a network becomes completely faulty. Instead, it can happen that some links
become more congested which can easily be captured by increasing weight on the
corresponding edges. Thus it makes sense to try to construct a sparse distance
preserving subgraph under the above weight increment model. To the best of our
knowledge this problem has not been studied so far. In this paper we show that
given any weighted directed graph with $n$ vertices and a source vertex, one
can construct a subgraph that contains at most $e \cdot (k-1)!2^kn$ many edges
such that it preserves distances between the source and all other vertices as
long as the total weight increment is bounded by $k$ and we are allowed to have
only integer valued (can be negative) weight on each edge and also weight of an
edge can only be increased by some positive integer. Next we show a lower bound
of $c\cdot 2^kn$, for some constant $c \ge 5/4$, on the size of the subgraph.
We also argue that restriction of integer valued weight and integer valued
weight increment are actually essential by showing that if we remove any one of
these two restrictions we may need to store $\Omega(n^2)$ edges to preserve

efficient management of early interventions. It is also equally important to
monitor spatial and temporal changes in the inundation area to track the
post-disaster recovery. On January 25th, 2019, the tailings dam of the
C\'orrego do Feij\~ao iron ore mine, located in Brumadinho, Brazil, collapsed.
This disaster caused more than 230 fatalities and 30 missing people leading to
damage on the order of multiple billions of dollars. This study uses Sentinel-2
satellite images to map the inundation area and assess and delineate the land
use and land cover impacted by the dam failure. The images correspond to data
captures from January 22nd (3 days before), and February 02 (7 days after the
collapse). Satellite images of the region were classified for before and
aftermath of the disaster implementing a machine learning algorithm. In order
to have sufficient land cover types to validate the quality and accuracy of the
algorithm, 7 classes were defined: mine, forest, build-up, river, agricultural,
clear water, and grassland. The developed classification algorithm yielded a
high accuracy (99%) for the image before the collapse. This paper determines
land cover impact using two different models, 1) by using the trained network
in the ""after"" image, and 2) by creating a second network, trained in a subset
of points of the ""after"" image, and then comparing the land cover results of
the two trained networks. In the first model, applying the trained network to
the ""after"" image, the accuracy is still high (86%), but lower than using the
second model (98%). This strategy can be applied at a low cost for monitoring
and assessment by using openly available satellite information and, in case of
dam collapse or with a larger budget, higher resolution and faster data can be
obtained by fly-overs on the area of concern.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

for multiple relation types and furnish the Hierarchical Bayesian treatment of
the proposed probabilistic model to avoid overfitting for solving the LPP

machinery that, instead of expressibility in CMSO logic, uses dynamic
programming, which allows us to find an explicit upper bound on the size of the

the first explicit linear kernels for $r$-Dominating Set and $r$-Scattered Set

  Compression Co-Optimization","State-of-the-art Transformer-based models, with gigantic parameters, are
difficult to be accommodated on resource constrained embedded devices.
Moreover, with the development of technology, more and more embedded devices
are available to run a Transformer model. For a Transformer model with
different constraints (tight or loose), it can be deployed onto devices with
different computing power. However, in previous work, designers did not choose
the best device among multiple devices. Instead, they just used an existing
device to deploy model, which was not necessarily the best fit and may lead to
underutilization of resources. To address the deployment challenge of
Transformer and the problem to select the best device, we propose an algorithm
& hardware closed-loop acceleration framework. Given a dataset, a model,
latency constraint LC and accuracy constraint AC, our framework can provide a
best device satisfying both constraints. In order to generate a compressed
model with high sparsity ratio, we propose a novel pruning technique,
hierarchical pruning (HP). We optimize the sparse matrix storage format for HP
matrix to further reduce memory usage for FPGA implementation. We design a
accelerator that takes advantage of HP to solve the problem of concurrent
random access. Experiments on Transformer and TinyBert model show that our
framework can find different devices for various LC and AC, covering from
low-end devices to high-end devices. Our HP can achieve higher sparsity ratio
and is more flexible than other sparsity pattern. Our framework can achieve

may result in RL agents observing higher (or lower) rewards than they should.
For example, a reinforcement learning agent may prefer states where a sensory

We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called
Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under
strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly
corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving
the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and

  regression","HEP event selection is traditionally considered a binary classification
problem, involving the dichotomous categories of signal and background. In
distribution fits for particle masses or couplings, however, signal events are
not all equivalent, as the signal differential cross section has different
sensitivities to the measured parameter in different regions of phase space. In
this paper, I describe a mathematical framework for the evaluation and
optimization of HEP parameter fits, where this sensitivity is defined on an
event-by-event basis, and for MC events it is modeled in terms of their MC
weight derivatives with respect to the measured parameter. Minimising the
statistical error on a measurement implies the need to resolve (i.e. separate)
events with different sensitivities, which ultimately represents a
non-dichotomous classification problem. Since MC weight derivatives are not
available for real data, the practical strategy I suggest consists in training
a regressor of weight derivatives against MC events, and then using it as an
optimal partitioning variable for 1-dimensional fits of data events. This
CHEP2019 paper is an extension of the study presented at CHEP2018: in
particular, event-by-event sensitivities allow the exact computation of the
""FIP"" ratio between the Fisher information obtained from an analysis and the
maximum information that could possibly be obtained with an ideal detector.
Using this expression, I discuss the relationship between FIP and two metrics
commonly used in Meteorology (Brier score and MSE), and the importance of
""sharpness"" both in HEP and in that domain. I finally point out that HEP
distribution fits should be optimized and evaluated using probabilistic metrics
(like FIP or MSE), whereas ranking metrics (like AUC) or threshold metrics

  Sharing of Misinformation on Social Media","When users on social media share content without considering its veracity,
they may unwittingly be spreading misinformation. In this work, we investigate
the design of lightweight interventions that nudge users to assess the accuracy
of information as they share it. Such assessment may deter users from posting
misinformation in the first place, and their assessments may also provide
useful guidance to friends aiming to assess those posts themselves. In support
of lightweight assessment, we first develop a taxonomy of the reasons why
people believe a news claim is or is not true; this taxonomy yields a checklist
that can be used at posting time. We conduct evaluations to demonstrate that
the checklist is an accurate and comprehensive encapsulation of people's
free-response rationales. In a second experiment, we study the effects of three
behavioral nudges -- 1) checkboxes indicating whether headings are accurate, 2)
tagging reasons (from our taxonomy) that a post is accurate via a checklist and
3) providing free-text rationales for why a headline is or is not accurate --
on people's intention of sharing the headline on social media. From an
experiment with 1668 participants, we find that both providing accuracy
assessment and rationale reduce the sharing of false content. They also reduce
the sharing of true content, but to a lesser degree that yields an overall
decrease in the fraction of shared content that is false. Our findings have
implications for designing social media and news sharing platforms that draw
from richer signals of content credibility contributed by users. In addition,
our validated taxonomy can be used by platforms and researchers as a way to

perfect matchings, spanning trees, spanning cycles (tours), and triangulations.
  (i) We present a new lower bound construction for the maximum number of
triangulations a set of n points in general position can have. In particular,
we show that a generalized double chain formed by two almost convex chains

makes $\hat{G}$ Eulerian, i.e., it is guaranteed to contain an Eulerian tour.
Meshes whose edges admit Eulerian tours are crucial in coverage problems

  For $2$-complexes in $\mathbb{R}^2$ ($d=2$) under mild assumptions (that no
two adjacent edges of a $2$-cell in $K$ are boundary edges), we show that the

scalar multiples of the corresponding numbers in $K$. We prove corresponding
results for $3$-complexes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under an additional assumption that
the degree of a vertex in each $3$-cell containing it is $3$. In this setting,
every vertex in $\hat{G}$ is shown to have a degree of $6$.

ideas from sparse signal recovery, i-SpaSP operates by iteratively identifying
a larger set of important parameter groups (e.g., filters or neurons) within a
network that contribute most to the residual between pruned and dense network
output, then thresholding these groups based on a smaller, pre-defined pruning
ratio. For both two-layer and multi-layer network architectures with ReLU
activations, we show the error induced by pruning with i-SpaSP decays
polynomially, where the degree of this polynomial becomes arbitrarily large
based on the sparsity of the dense network's hidden representations. In our
experiments, i-SpaSP is evaluated across a variety of datasets (i.e., MNIST,
ImageNet, and XNLI) and architectures (i.e., feed forward networks, ResNet34,
MobileNetV2, and BERT), where it is shown to discover high-performing
sub-networks and improve upon the pruning efficiency of provable baseline
methodologies by several orders of magnitude. Put simply, i-SpaSP is easy to
implement with automatic differentiation, achieves strong empirical results,
comes with theoretical convergence guarantees, and is efficient, thus
distinguishing itself as one of the few computationally efficient, practical,

concurrency where agents interact by telling and asking constraints. Since
their inception, CCP-languages have been designed for having a strong
connection to logic. In fact, the underlying constraint system can be built
from a suitable fragment of intuitionistic (linear) logic --ILL-- and processes
can be interpreted as formulas in ILL. Constraints as ILL formulas fail to
represent accurately situations where ""preferences"" (called soft constraints)
such as probabilities, uncertainty or fuzziness are present. In order to
circumvent this problem, c-semirings have been proposed as algebraic structures
for defining constraint systems where agents are allowed to tell and ask soft
constraints. Nevertheless, in this case, the tight connection to logic and
proof theory is lost. In this work, we give a proof theoretical interpretation
to soft constraints: they can be defined as formulas in a suitable fragment of
ILL with subexponentials (SELL) where subexponentials, ordered in a c-semiring
structure, are interpreted as preferences. We hence achieve two goals: (1)
obtain a CCP language where agents can tell and ask soft constraints and (2)
prove that the language in (1) has a strong connection with logic. Hence we
keep a declarative reading of processes as formulas while providing a logical
framework for soft-CCP based systems. An interesting side effect of (1) is that
one is also able to handle probabilities (and other modalities) in SELL, by
restricting the use of the promotion rule for non-idempotent c-semirings.This
finer way of controlling subexponentials allows for considering more
interesting spaces and restrictions, and it opens the possibility of specifying

delivery techniques that allow alternative playback qualities to be delivered

user's expected viewing direction is best done close to playback deadlines,
large buffers are needed to protect against shortfalls in future available
bandwidth. This results in conflicting goals and an important prefetch
aggressiveness tradeoff problem regarding how far ahead in time from the
current playpoint prefetching should be done. This paper presents the first
characterization of this tradeoff. The main contributions include an empirical
characterization of head movement behavior based on data from viewing sessions
of four different categories of 360$^{\circ}$ video, an optimization-based
comparison of the prefetch aggressiveness tradeoffs seen for these video
categories, and a data-driven discussion of further optimizations, which
include a novel system design that allows both tradeoff objectives to be

reasons for the mistakes for concrete cases and models?

we still need to provide decision-makers with the importance of individual
attributes to the classification of a particular object, which may facilitate
explanations by experts in various domains with high-cost errors like medicine

  (Concerning the Scale Dependence Of System Promises)","Several popular best-practice manifestos for IT design and architecture use
terms like `stateful', `stateless', `shared nothing', etc, and describe `fact
based' or `functional' descriptions of causal evolution to describe computer
processes, especially in cloud computing. The concepts are used ambiguously and
sometimes in contradictory ways, which has led to many imprecise beliefs about
their implications. This paper outlines the simple view of state and causation
in Promise Theory, which accounts for the scaling of processes and the
relativity of different observers in a natural way. It's shown that the
concepts of statefulness or statelessness are artifacts of observational scale
and causal bias towards functional evaluation. If we include feedback loops,
recursion, and process convergence, which appear acausal to external observers,
the arguments about (im)mutable state need to be modified in a scale-dependent
way. In most cases the intended focus of such remarks is not terms like
`statelessness' but process predictability. A simple principle may be
substituted in most cases as a guide to system design: the principle the
separation of dynamic scales.
  Understanding data reliance and the ability to keep stable promises is of
crucial importance to the consistency of data pipelines, and distributed
client-server interactions, albeit in different ways. With increasingly data
intensive processes over widely separated distributed deployments, e.g. in the

  Learning","The development of QoE models by means of Machine Learning (ML) is
challenging, amongst others due to small-size datasets, lack of diversity in
user profiles in the source domain, and too much diversity in the target
domains of QoE models. Furthermore, datasets can be hard to share between
research entities, as the machine learning models and the collected user data
from the user studies may be IPR- or GDPR-sensitive. This makes a decentralized
learning-based framework appealing for sharing and aggregating learned
knowledge in-between the local models that map the obtained metrics to the user
QoE, such as Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). In this paper, we present a transfer
learning-based ML model training approach, which allows decentralized local
models to share generic indicators on MOS to learn a generic base model, and
then customize the generic base model further using additional features that
are unique to those specific localized (and potentially sensitive) QoE nodes.
We show that the proposed approach is agnostic to specific ML algorithms,
stacked upon each other, as it does not necessitate the collaborating localized
nodes to run the same ML algorithm. Our reproducible results reveal the
advantages of stacking various generic and specific models with corresponding
weight factors. Moreover, we identify the optimal combination of algorithms and

weight function $w: V(G) \to \mathbb{R}^+$, the weight of a color $S_i$ is
defined as $w(i) = \max_{v \in S_i} w(v)$ and the weight of a coloring $c$ as
$w(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}w(i)$. Guan and Zhu [Inf. Process. Lett., 1997] defined
the weighted chromatic number of a pair $(G,w)$, denoted by $\sigma(G,w)$, as
the minimum weight of a proper coloring of $G$. For a positive integer $r$,
they also defined $\sigma(G,w;r)$ as the minimum of $w(c)$ among all proper

discounted surplus. For this setting, first, we propose a novel algorithm that
never decreases offered prices and has a tight strategic regret bound in
$\Theta(\log\log T)$ under some mild assumptions on the buyer surplus
discounting. This result closes the open research question on the existence of
a no-regret horizon-independent weakly consistent pricing. The proposed

This motivates us to construct a novel transformation that maps a

subsequently be applied to the edited model. Experimental results, including

  Inverter Arrays","We propose a novel compute-in-memory (CIM)-based ultra-low-power framework
for probabilistic localization of insect-scale drones. The conventional
probabilistic localization approaches rely on the three-dimensional (3D)
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based representation of a 3D map. A GMM model with
hundreds of mixture functions is typically needed to adequately learn and
represent the intricacies of the map. Meanwhile, localization using complex GMM
map models is computationally intensive. Since insect-scale drones operate
under extremely limited area/power budget, continuous localization using GMM
models entails much higher operating energy -- thereby, limiting flying
duration and/or size of the drone due to a larger battery. Addressing the
computational challenges of localization in an insect-scale drone using a CIM
approach, we propose a novel framework of 3D map representation using a
harmonic mean of ""Gaussian-like"" mixture (HMGM) model. The likelihood function
useful for drone localization can be efficiently implemented by connecting many
multi-input inverters in parallel, each programmed with the parameters of the
3D map model represented as HMGM. When the depth measurements are projected to
the input of the implementation, the summed current of the inverters emulates
the likelihood of the measurement. We have characterized our approach on an
RGB-D indoor localization dataset. The average localization error in our
approach is $\sim$0.1125 m which is only slightly degraded than software-based
evaluation ($\sim$0.08 m). Meanwhile, our localization framework is
ultra-low-power, consuming as little as $\sim$17 $\mu$W power while processing

individual and rippling through social networks. Moreover, it can spread not
only through third-party influence from observation, just like innovations or
individual behavior do, but also through direct experience, via
""pay-it-forward"" retaliation. Here, we distinguish between the effects of
observation and victimization for the contagion of antisocial behavior by
analyzing large-scale digital-trace data. We study the spread of cheating in
more than a million matches of an online multiplayer first-person shooter game,
in which up to 100 players compete individually or in teams against strangers.
We identify event sequences in which a player who observes or is killed by a
certain number of cheaters starts cheating, and evaluate the extent to which
these sequences would appear if we preserve the team and interaction structure
but assume alternative gameplay scenarios. The results reveal that social
contagion is only likely to exist for those who both observe and experience
cheating, suggesting that third-party influence and ""pay-it-forward""
reciprocity interact positively. In addition, the effect is present only for
those who both observe and experience more than once, suggesting that cheating
is more likely to spread after repeated or multi-source exposure. Approaching

families of local rings.
  The algorithms use the \emph{black-box} model which is suitable for sparse
and structured matrices. The algorithms depend on a number of tools, such as
matrix rank computation over finite fields, for which the best-known time- and
memory-efficient algorithms are probabilistic.
  For an $\nxn$ matrix $A$ over the ring $\Fzfe$, where $f^e$ is a power of an
irreducible polynomial $f \in \Fz$ of degree $d$, our algorithm requires
$\bigO(\eta de^2n)$ operations in $\F$, where our black-box is assumed to
require $\bigO(\eta)$ operations in $\F$ to compute a matrix-vector product by
a vector over $\Fzfe$ (and $\eta$ is assumed greater than $\Pden$). The
algorithm only requires additional storage for $\bigO(\Pden)$ elements of $\F$.
In particular, if $\eta=\softO(\Pden)$, then our algorithm requires only
$\softO(n^2d^2e^3)$ operations in $\F$, which is an improvement on known dense
methods for small $d$ and $e$.
  For the ring $\ZZ/p^e\ZZ$, where $p$ is a prime, we give an algorithm which
is time- and memory-efficient when the number of nontrivial invariant factors
is small. We describe a method for dimension reduction while preserving the
invariant factors. The time complexity is essentially linear in $\mu n r e \log
p,$ where $\mu$ is the number of operations in $\ZZ/p\ZZ$ to evaluate the
black-box (assumed greater than $n$) and $r$ is the total number of non-zero
invariant factors.
  To avoid the practical cost of conditioning, we give a Monte Carlo
certificate, which at low cost, provides either a high probability of success
or a proof of failure. The quest for a time- and memory-efficient solution

logic, determine if $M$ contains a substructure $M'$ (with the same initial
state) that satisfies $\eta$. Thus, $M$ can be ``repaired'' to satisfy the
specification $\eta$ by deleting some transitions.
  We map an instance $(M, \eta)$ of model repair to a boolean formula
$\repfor(M,\eta)$ such that $(M, \eta)$ has a solution iff $\repfor(M,\eta)$ is
satisfiable. Furthermore, a satisfying assignment determines which transitions
must be removed from $M$ to generate a model $M'$ of $\eta$. Thus, we can use
any SAT solver to repair Kripke structures. Furthermore, using a complete SAT
solver yields a complete algorithm: it always finds a repair if one exists.

programs, to solve the discrete event supervisory control problem

Boolean algebra $B_{0}=\{0,1\}$ and find all satisfying assignments. The
algorithm is based on the application of a well known generalized Boole-Shannon
orthonormal (ON) expansion of Boolean functions. A necessary and sufficient
consistency condition for a special class of functions was developed in
\cite{sule} using such an expansion. Paper \cite{sule} develops a condition for
consistency of the equation $f(X)=0$ for the special classes of Boolean
functions 1) $f$ in $B(\Phi(X))$ for an ON set $\Phi$ of Boolean functions in
$X$ over a general Boolean algebra $B$ and 2) $f$ in $B(X_{2})(\Phi(X_{1}))$.
The present paper addresses the problem of obtaining the consistency conditions
for arbitrary Boolean functions in $B_{0}(X)$. Next, the consistency for a
single equation is shown equivalent to another system of Boolean equations
which involves the ON functions and characterizes all solutions. This result is
then extended for Boolean systems in several variables over the algebra
$B_{0}=\{0,1\}$ which does not convert the system into a single equation. This
condition leads to the algorithm for computing all solutions of the Boolean
system without using analogous resolution and determine satisfiability. For
special systems defined by CNF formulas this algorithm results into an
extension of the DPLL algorithm in which the \emph{splitting rule} is
generalized to several variables in terms of ON terms in the sense that

mapping from a vector to a descriptor that represents essential information can

information. However, an image and its spatially shifted version are encoded
into different descriptors by an existing ordinary auto-encoder because each
descriptor includes a spatial subpattern and its position. To generate a
descriptor representing a spatial subpattern in an image, we need to normalize
its spatial position in the images prior to training an ordinary auto-encoder;
however, such a normalization is generally difficult for images without obvious
standard positions. We propose a transform invariant auto-encoder and an
inference model of transform parameters. By the proposed method, we can
separate an input into a transform invariant descriptor and transform
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to various auto-encoders without
requiring any special modules or labeled training samples. By applying it to
shift transforms, we can achieve a shift invariant auto-encoder that can
extract a typical spatial subpattern independent of its relative position in a
window. In addition, we can achieve a model that can infer shift parameters

world coordinates to a feature representation of local scene properties. By
formulating the image formation as a differentiable ray-marching algorithm,
SRNs can be trained end-to-end from only 2D images and their camera poses,
without access to depth or shape. This formulation naturally generalizes across
scenes, learning powerful geometry and appearance priors in the process. We

geometric construction that has been extensively studied over three decades as
it possesses the two most basic properties of a good spanner: constant maximum
degree and constant lightness. Recently, Eppstein and Khodabandeh showed that
the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a sublinear separator in a strong
sense: any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has
a separator of size $O(\sqrt{k})$. Their technique is inherently planar and is
not extensible to higher dimensions. They left showing the existence of a small
separator for the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any constant $d\geq 3$
as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve the problem of Eppstein and
Khodabandeh by showing that any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(k^{1-1/d})$. We introduce a new
technique that gives a simple characterization for any geometric graph to have
a sublinear separator that we dub $\tau$-lanky: a geometric graph is
$\tau$-lanky if any ball of radius $r$ cuts at most $\tau$ edges of length at
least $r$ in the graph. We show that any $\tau$-lanky geometric graph of $n$
vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(\tau n^{1-1/d})$. We then
derive our main result by showing that the greedy spanner is $O(1)$-lanky. We
indeed obtain a more general result that applies to unit ball graphs and point
sets of low fractal dimensions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our technique naturally
extends to doubling metrics. We use the $\tau$-lanky characterization to show
that there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner for doubling metrics of dimension

been introduced in the community as an iterative process updating a clustering

the real-word data is reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.

one-third of the cancer cases. Benign skin cancers are not fatal, can be cured
with proper medication. But it is not the same as the malignant skin cancers.
In the case of malignant melanoma, in its peak stage, the maximum life
expectancy is less than or equal to 5 years. But, it can be cured if detected
in early stages. Though there are numerous clinical procedures, the accuracy of
diagnosis falls between 49% to 81% and is time-consuming. So, dermoscopy has
been brought into the picture. It helped in increasing the accuracy of
diagnosis but could not demolish the error-prone behaviour. A quick and less
error-prone solution is needed to diagnose this majorly growing skin cancer.
This project deals with the usage of deep learning in skin lesion
classification. In this project, an automated model for skin lesion
classification using dermoscopic images has been developed with CNN(Convolution
Neural Networks) as a training model. Convolution neural networks are known for
capturing features of an image. So, they are preferred in analyzing medical
images to find the characteristics that drive the model towards success.
Techniques like data augmentation for tackling class imbalance, segmentation
for focusing on the region of interest and 10-fold cross-validation to make the
model robust have been brought into the picture. This project also includes
usage of certain preprocessing techniques like brightening the images using
piece-wise linear transformation function, grayscale conversion of the image,
resize the image. This project throws a set of valuable insights on how the

In contrast, the LM does not seem to perform as well when dealing with pattern

design. However, the PoA relies on strong assumptions about agents' rationality

Disjunctive Datalog, which significantly increases the expressivity of the

ranging from Databases (e.g., Data Integration) to Artificial Intelligence
(e.g., diagnosis and planning under incomplete knowledge). However, in recent
years an important shortcoming of Datalog-based languages became evident, e.g.
in the context of data-integration (consistent query-answering, ontology-based
data access) and Semantic Web applications: The language does not permit any
generation of and reasoning with unnamed individuals in an obvious way. In
general, it is weak in supporting many cases of existential quantification. To
overcome this problem, Datalogex has recently been proposed, which extends
traditional Datalog by existential quantification in rule heads. In this work,
we propose a natural extension of Disjunctive Datalog and Datalogex, called
Datalogexor, which allows both disjunctions and existential quantification in
rule heads and is therefore an attractive language for knowledge representation
and reasoning, especially in domains where ontology-based reasoning is needed.

(network) graph $G$, a set of sources $I \subseteq G$ initiate flooding in the
first round by every node in $I$ sending the same message to all of its
neighbours. In each subsequent round, nodes send the message to all of their
neighbours from which they did not receive the message in the previous round.
Flooding terminates when no node in $G$ sends a message in a round. The
question of termination has not been settled - rather, non-termination is
implicitly assumed to be possible.
  We show that flooding terminates on every finite graph. In the case of a
single source $g_0$, flooding terminates in $e$ rounds if $G$ is bipartite and
$j$ rounds with $e < j \leq e+d+1$ otherwise, where $e$ and $d$ are the
eccentricity of $g_0$ and diameter of $G$ respectively. For
communication/broadcast to all nodes, this is asymptotically time optimal and
obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning structures. We
extend to dynamic flooding initiated in multiple rounds with possibly multiple
messages. The cases where a node only sends a message to neighbours from which
it did not receive {\it any} message in the previous round, and where a node
sends some highest ranked message to all neighbours from which it did not
receive {\it that} message in the previous round, both terminate. All these
cases also hold if the network graph loses edges over time. Non-terminating

per BC network, for a total of 2345 snapshots. We construct, at frequent
intervals, connectivity graphs for each BC network, consisting of all potential
connections between peers. We analyze the structural graph properties of these
networks and compare them across the seven BC networks. We also study how these
properties associate with the resilience of each network to partitioning
attacks, i.e., when peers are selected, attacked and taken offline, using
different selection strategies driven by the aforementioned structural
properties. In fact, we show that by targeting fewer than 10 highly-connected
peers, major BCs such as Bitcoin can be partitioned into disjoint, i.e.,
disconnected, components. Finally, we uncover a hidden interconnection between

  Graphs","Many load balancing problems that arise in scientific computing applications
ask to partition a graph with weights on the vertices and costs on the edges
into a given number of almost equally-weighted parts such that the maximum
boundary cost over all parts is small.
  Here, this partitioning problem is considered for bounded-degree graphs
G=(V,E) with edge costs c: E->R+ that have a p-separator theorem for some p>1,
i.e., any (arbitrarily weighted) subgraph of G can be separated into two parts
of roughly the same weight by removing a vertex set S such that the edges
incident to S in the subgraph have total cost at most proportional to (SUM_e
c^p_e)^(1/p), where the sum is over all edges e in the subgraph.
  We show for all positive integers k and weights w that the vertices of G can
be partitioned into k parts such that the weight of each part differs from the
average weight by less than MAX{w_v; v in V}, and the boundary edges of each
part have cost at most proportional to (SUM_e c_e^p/k)^(1/p) + MAX_e c_e. The
partition can be computed in time nearly proportional to the time for computing
a separator S of G.
  Our upper bound on the boundary costs is shown to be tight up to a constant
factor for infinitely many instances with a broad range of parameters. Previous
results achieved this bound only if one has c=1, w=1, and one allows parts with

paradigm in the nowadays industrialized world is the need to increase
flexibility and responsiveness of manufacturing companies. The high-mix /
low-volume production forces constant accommodations of unknown product
variants, which ultimately leads to high periods of machine calibration. The
difficulty related with machine calibration is that experience is required
together with a set of experiments to meet the final product quality.
Unfortunately, all possible combinations of machine parameters is so high that
is difficult to build empirical knowledge. Due to this fact, normally trial and
error approaches are taken making one-of-a-kind products not viable. Therefore,
a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) based approach called hyper-process model (HPM) to
learn the relation among multiple tasks is used as a way to shorten the
calibration phase. Assuming each product variant is a task to solve, first, a
shape analysis on data to learn common modes of deformation between tasks is
made, and secondly, a mapping between these modes and task descriptions is
performed. Ultimately, the present work has two main contributions: 1)
Formulation of an industrial problem into a ZSL setting where new process
models can be generated for process optimization and 2) the definition of a
regression problem in the domain of ZSL. For that purpose, a 2-d deep drawing

not fit the general patterns. The concept of the anomaly is typically
ill-defined and perceived as vague and domain-dependent. Moreover, despite some
250 years of publications on the topic, no comprehensive and concrete overviews
of the different types of anomalies have hitherto been published. By means of
an extensive literature review this study therefore offers the first
theoretically principled and domain-independent typology of data anomalies and
presents a full overview of anomaly types and subtypes. To concretely define
the concept of the anomaly and its different manifestations, the typology
employs five dimensions: data type, cardinality of relationship, anomaly level,
data structure, and data distribution. These fundamental and data-centric
dimensions naturally yield 3 broad groups, 9 basic types, and 63 subtypes of
anomalies. The typology facilitates the evaluation of the functional
capabilities of anomaly detection algorithms, contributes to explainable data
science, and provides insights into relevant topics such as local versus global

Consistency rules are used to deal with inconsistencies in models. However,
guidelines and consistency rules use informal restrictions on the uses of

problems from a language-theoretic view. We propose the formalism of C-Systems,
short for ""formal language control systems"". A C-System consists of a
controlled grammar and a controlling grammar. Guidelines and consistency rules
are formalized as controlling grammars that control the uses of UML, i.e. the
derivations using the grammar of UML. This approach can be implemented as a
parser, which can automatically verify the rules on a UML user model in XMI

cycle on it, we are interested in finding the cycle with minimal weight which
is homologous to the given one. Assuming that the homology is defined with
integer coefficients, we show the following : For a finite simplicial complex
$K$ of dimension greater than $p$, the boundary matrix $[\partial_{p+1}]$ is
totally unimodular if and only if $H_p(L, L_0)$ is torsion-free, for all pure
subcomplexes $L_0, L$ in $K$ of dimensions $p$ and $p+1$ respectively, where
$L_0$ is a subset of $L$. Because of the total unimodularity of the boundary
matrix, we can solve the optimization problem, which is inherently an integer
programming problem, as a linear program and obtain integer solution. Thus the
problem of finding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved in
polynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a recent result
which says that the problem is NP-hard under $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients which,
being a field, is in general easier to deal with. One consequence of our
result, among others, is that one can compute in polynomial time an optimal
2-cycle in a given homology class for any finite simplicial complex embedded in

interventions with the goal of conflict transformation: not suppressing or
eliminating conflict but moving towards more constructive conflict. Algorithmic
intervention is considered at three stages: which content is available
(moderation), how content is selected and personalized (ranking), and content
presentation and controls (user interface). Empirical studies of online
conflict suggest that the exposure diversity intervention proposed as an
antidote to ""filter bubbles"" can be improved and can even worsen polarization
under some conditions. Using civility metrics in conjunction with diversity in
content selection may be more effective. However, diversity-based interventions
have not been tested at scale and may not work in the diverse and dynamic
contexts of real platforms. Instead, intervening in platform polarization
dynamics will likely require continuous monitoring of polarization metrics,

doing this, we notice that one has to use a countable choice axiom in the proof

Double-negation Shift can nonetheless be derived in a constructive intermediate

decidable. Its defining principle is that universally and existentially
quantified variables may not occur together in atoms. The known upper bound on
the time required to decide SF's satisfiability problem is formulated in terms
of quantifier alternations: Given an SF sentence $\exists \vec{z} \forall
\vec{x}_1 \exists \vec{y}_1 \ldots \forall \vec{x}_n \exists \vec{y}_n . \psi$
in which $\psi$ is quantifier free, satisfiability can be decided in
nondeterministic $n$-fold exponential time. In the present paper, we conduct a
more fine-grained analysis of the complexity of SF-satisfiability. We derive an
upper and a lower bound in terms of the degree of interaction of existential
variables (short: degree)}---a novel measure of how many separate existential
quantifier blocks in a sentence are connected via joint occurrences of
variables in atoms. Our main result is the $k$-NEXPTIME-completeness of the
satisfiability problem for the set $SF_{\leq k}$ of all SF sentences that have
degree $k$ or smaller. Consequently, we show that SF-satisfiability is
non-elementary in general, since SF is defined without restrictions on the
degree. Beyond trivial lower bounds, nothing has been known about the hardness

color distortion, unknown noise, detail loss and halo artifacts. In this paper,
we propose a Degradation-Aware Deep Retinex Network (denoted as DA-DRN) for

Theory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into

Degradation-Aware Module (DA Module) which can guide the training process of
the decomposer and enable the decomposer to be a restorer during the training
phase without additional computational cost in the test phase. DA Module can
achieve the purpose of noise removal while preserving detail information into
the illumination map as well as tackle color distortion and halo artifacts. We
introduce Perceptual Loss to train the enhancement network to generate the
brightness-improved illumination maps which are more consistent with human
visual perception. We train and evaluate the performance of our proposed model
over the LOL real-world and LOL synthetic datasets, and we also test our model

tolerate a certain degree of overlap without being in conflict. This subclass
of perfect graphs has been extensively studied, due to both its interesting
structure and its numerous applications. Several efficient algorithms for
optimization problems that are NP-hard on general graphs have been designed for
tolerance graphs. In spite of this, the recognition of tolerance graphs -
namely, the problem of deciding whether a given graph is a tolerance graph - as
well as the recognition of their main subclass of bounded tolerance graphs,
have been the most fundamental open problems on this class of graphs (cf. the
book on tolerance graphs \cite{GolTol04}) since their introduction in 1982
\cite{GoMo82}. In this article we prove that both recognition problems are
NP-complete, even in the case where the input graph is a trapezoid graph. The
presented results are surprising because, on the one hand, most subclasses of
perfect graphs admit polynomial recognition algorithms and, on the other hand,
bounded tolerance graphs were believed to be efficiently recognizable as they
are a natural special case of trapezoid graphs (which can be recognized in
polynomial time) and share a very similar structure with them. For our
reduction we extend the notion of an \emph{acyclic orientation} of permutation
and trapezoid graphs. Our main tool is a new algorithm that uses \emph{vertex
splitting} to transform a given trapezoid graph into a permutation graph, while
preserving this new acyclic orientation property. This method of vertex
splitting is of independent interest; very recently, it has been proved a

method, in which large databases are used instead of experimental observations

empirical data allows the scientific method to be applied to several aspects of
physical reality that previously resisted systematic interrogation. Under the
new method, scientific theories are compared by instantiating them as
compression programs, and examining the codelengths they achieve on a database
of measurements related to a phenomenon of interest. Because of the
impossibility of compressing random data, ""real world"" data can only be
compressed by discovering and exploiting the empirical structure it exhibits.
The method also provides a new way of thinking about two longstanding issues in
the philosophy of science: the problem of induction and the problem of
demarcation.
  The second part of the paper proposes to reformulate computer vision as an
empirical science of visual reality, by applying the new method to large
databases of natural images. The immediate goal of the proposed reformulation
is to repair the chronic difficulties in evaluation experienced by the field of
computer vision. The reformulation should bring a wide range of benefits,
including a substantially increased degree of methodological rigor, the ability
to justify complex theories without overfitting, a scalable evaluation
paradigm, and the potential to make systematic progress. A crucial argument is
that the change is not especially drastic, because most computer vision tasks

  Teams","Background: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an emerging programming
paradigm whose focus is about improving modularity, with an emphasis on the
modularization of crosscutting concerns.
  Objective: The goal of this paper is to assess the extent to which an AOP
language -ObjectTeams/Java (OT/J) -improves the modularity of a software
system. This improvement has been claimed but, to the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the first attempting to present quantitative evidence of it.
  Method: We compare functionally-equivalent implementations of the
Gang-of-Four design patterns, developed in Java and OT/J, using software
metrics.
  Results: The results of our comparison support the modularity improvement
claims made in the literature. For six of the seven metrics used, the OT/J
versions of the patterns obtained significantly better results.
  Limitations: This work uses a set of metrics originally defined for
object-oriented (OO) systems. It may be the case that the metrics are biased,
in that they were created in the context of OO programming (OOP), before the
advent of AOP. We consider this comparison a stepping stone as, ultimately, we
plan to assess the modularity improvements with paradigm independent metrics,
which will conceivably eliminate the bias. Each individual example from the
sample used in this paper is small. In future, we plan to replicate this
experiment using larger systems, where the benefits of AOP may be more
noticeable.
  Conclusion: This work contributes with evidence to fill gaps in the body of
quantitative results supporting alleged benefits to software modularity brought
by AOP languages, namely OT/J.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

governing sequences of words. In each case, successful performance on the test
set requires generalising to features that were not present in the training

  Optimization","Because the presence of views enhances query performance, materialized views

Whenever the data warehouse is updated, the materialized views must also be
updated. However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse, the query

window available for making the warehouse up-to-date is shrinking. These trends
necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.
  In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for maintenance of a

maintenance expressions. These common subexpressions may be materialized
temporarily during view maintenance. Our algorithms also choose
subexpressions/indices to be materialized permanently (and maintained along

been much work on view maintenance in the past, our novel contributions lie in

to place it in W[3]). Given a single ""free"" element of the domain, denoted by
$0$, we define the size of an assignment as the number of variables that are
mapped to a value other than $0$. Named by Kolaitis and Vardi (2000), uniform
CSP means that the input contains the domain and the list of tuples of each
relation in the instance. Uniform CSP is polynomial time equivalent to
homomorphism problem and also to evaluation of conjunctive queries on
relational databases. It also has applications in artificial intelligence.
  We do not restrict the problem to any (finite or infinite) family of
relations. Marx and Bulatov (2014) showed that Uniform CSP restricted to some
finite family of relations (thus with a bound on the arity of relations) and
over any finite domain is either W[1]-complete or fixed parameter tractable.

  Lastly, we study the weighted CSP over the Boolean Domain, where each
variable is assigned a weight, and given a target value, it should be decided
if there is a satisfying assignment of size $k$ (the parameter) such that the
weight of its $1$-variables adds up to the target value. We prove that if the

memristor's operation: 1. Strukov et al's phenomenological model; 2. Georgiou
et al's Bernoulli rewrite of that phenomenological model; 3. Gale's
memory-conservation model. They differ in their prediction of the effect on
memristance of changing the electrode size and factors that affect the
hysteresis. Using a batch of TiO$_2$ sol-gel memristors fabricated with
different top electrode widths we test and compare these three theories. It was
found that, contrary to model 2's prediction, the `dimensionless lumped
parameter', $\beta$, did not correlate to any measure of the hysteresis.
Contrary to model 1, memristance was found to be dependent on the three spatial
dimensions of the TiO$_2$ layer, as was predicted by model 3. Model 3 was found
to fit the change in resistance value with electrode size. Simulations using
model 3 and experimentally derived values for contact resistance gave
hysteresis values that were linearly related to (and only one order of
magnitude out) from the experimentally-measured values. Memristor hysteresis
was found to be related to the ON state resistance and thus the electrode size
(as those two are related). These results offer a verification of the
memory-conservation theory of memristance and its association of the vacancy
magnetic flux with the missing magnetic flux in memristor theory. This is the

networks including some which approximate the measured degree distribution of
the Internet. Their results suggest that if each node in this network failed
independently with probability 0.99, the remaining network would continue to
have a giant component. In this paper, we show that a large and important
subclass of scale-free networks are not robust to massive numbers of random
node deletions for practical purposes. In particular, we study finite
scale-free networks which have minimum node degree of 1 and a power-law degree
distribution beginning with nodes of degree 1 (power-law networks). We show
that, in a power-law network approximating the Internet's reported
distribution, when the probability of deletion of each node is 0.5 only about
25% of the surviving nodes in the network remain connected in a giant
component, and the giant component does not persist beyond a critical failure
rate of 0.9. The new result is partially due to improved analytical
accommodation of the large number of degree-0 nodes that result after node
deletions. Our results apply to finite power-law networks with a wide range of

compiler generator instead of a specialiser, has been used with considerable
success in partial evaluation of both functional and imperative languages. This
paper demonstrates that the cogen approach is also applicable to the
specialisation of logic programs (also called partial deduction) and leads to
effective specialisers. Moreover, using good binding-time annotations, the
speed-ups of the specialised programs are comparable to the speed-ups obtained
with online specialisers. The paper first develops a generic approach to
offline partial deduction and then a specific offline partial deduction method,
leading to the offline system LIX for pure logic programs. While this is a
usable specialiser by itself, it is used to develop the cogen system LOGEN.
Given a program, a specification of what inputs will be static, and an
annotation specifying which calls should be unfolded, LOGEN generates a
specialised specialiser for the program at hand. Running this specialiser with
particular values for the static inputs results in the specialised program.
While this requires two steps instead of one, the efficiency of the
specialisation process is improved in situations where the same program is
specialised multiple times. The paper also presents and evaluates an automatic
binding-time analysis that is able to derive the annotations. While the derived
annotations are still suboptimal compared to hand-crafted ones, they enable
non-expert users to use the LOGEN system in a fully automated way. Finally,

a set of gallery (database) images. Such systems are used in various
applications e.g. person re-identification (ReID) or visual product search.
Despite active development of retrieval models it still remains a challenging
task mainly due to large intra-class variance caused by changes in view angle,
lighting, background clutter or occlusion, while inter-class variance may be
relatively low. A large portion of current research focuses on creating more
robust features and modifying objective functions, usually based on Triplet
Loss. Some works experiment with using centroid/proxy representation of a class
to alleviate problems with computing speed and hard samples mining used with
Triplet Loss. However, these approaches are used for training alone and
discarded during the retrieval stage. In this paper we propose to use the mean
centroid representation both during training and retrieval. Such an aggregated
representation is more robust to outliers and assures more stable features. As
each class is represented by a single embedding - the class centroid - both
retrieval time and storage requirements are reduced significantly. Aggregating
multiple embeddings results in a significant reduction of the search space due
to lowering the number of candidate target vectors, which makes the method
especially suitable for production deployments. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on two ReID and Fashion Retrieval datasets demonstrate effectiveness
of our method, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art. We propose

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03397v1,"SAIC: Identifying Configuration Files for System Configuration
  Management","Systems can become misconfigured for a variety of reasons such as operator
errors or buggy patches. When a misconfiguration is discovered, usually the
first order of business is to restore availability, often by undoing the
misconfiguration. To simplify this task, we propose the Statistical Analysis
for Identifying Configuration Files (SAIC), which analyzes how the contents of
a file changes over time to automatically determine which files contain
configuration state. In this way, SAIC reduces the number of files a user must
manually examine during recovery and allows versioning file systems to make
more efficient use of their versioning storage.
  The two key insights that enable SAIC to identify configuration files are
that configuration state must persist across executions of an application and
that configuration state changes at a slower rate than other types of
application state. SAIC applies these insights through a set of filters, which
eliminate non-persistent files from consideration, and a novel similarity
metric, which measures how similar a file's versions are to each other.
Together, these two mechanisms enable SAIC to identify all 72 configuration
files out of 2363 versioned files from 6 common applications in two user
traces, while mistaking only 33 non-configuration files as configuration files,
which allows a versioning file system to eliminate roughly 66% of
non-configuration file versions from its logs, thus reducing the number of file
versions that a user must try to recover from a misconfiguration.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

$n \times n$ real symmetric matrices, we define its {\it spectrahull} as the
set $SH(\mathbf{S}) = \{p(X) \equiv (Tr(A_1 X), \dots, Tr(A_m X))^T : X \in

membership} (SHM) to be the problem of testing if a given $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$
lies in $SH(\mathbf{S})$. On the one hand when $A_i$'s are diagonal matrices,
SHM reduces to the {\it convex hull membership} (CHM), a fundamental problem in
LP. On the other hand, a bounded SDP feasibility is reducible to SHM. By
building on the {\it Triangle Algorithm} (TA) \cite{kalchar,kalsep}, developed
for CHM and its generalization, we design a TA for SHM, where given
$\varepsilon$, in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations it either computes a
hyperplane separating $b$ from $SH(\mathbf{S})$, or $X_\varepsilon \in
\mathbf{\Delta}_n$ such that $\Vert p(X_\varepsilon) - b \Vert \leq \varepsilon

testing the existence of a pivot, shown to be equivalent to estimating the
least eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix. This together with a semidefinite
version of Carath\'eodory theorem allow implementing TA as if solving a CHM,
resorting to the {\it power method} only as needed, thereby improving the

practical and applicable to general SDP feasibility and optimization. Also, it

  of Public Discussions of Crisis Events","Social media datasets make it possible to rapidly quantify collective
attention to emerging topics and breaking news, such as crisis events.
Collective attention is typically measured by aggregate counts, such as the
number of posts that mention a name or hashtag. But according to rationalist
models of natural language communication, the collective salience of each
entity will be expressed not only in how often it is mentioned, but in the form
that those mentions take. This is because natural language communication is
premised on (and customized to) the expectations that speakers and writers have
about how their messages will be interpreted by the intended audience. We test
this idea by conducting a large-scale analysis of public online discussions of
breaking news events on Facebook and Twitter, focusing on five recent crisis
events. We examine how people refer to locations, focusing specifically on
contextual descriptors, such as ""San Juan"" versus ""San Juan, Puerto Rico.""
Rationalist accounts of natural language communication predict that such
descriptors will be unnecessary (and therefore omitted) when the named entity
is expected to have high prior salience to the reader. We find that the use of
contextual descriptors is indeed associated with proxies for social and
informational expectations, including macro-level factors like the location's
global salience and micro-level factors like audience engagement. We also find
a consistent decrease in descriptor context use over the lifespan of each
crisis event. These findings provide evidence about how social media users
communicate with their audiences, and point towards more fine-grained models of
collective attention that may help researchers and crisis response
organizations to better understand public perception of unfolding crisis

based on fitting feed-forward neural networks to synthetic data sets

resolutions. These multilayer perceptrons process the level-set values from
mesh points next to the free boundary and output the dimensionless curvature at
their closest locations on the interface. Accuracy analyses involving irregular
interfaces, in both uniform and adaptive grids, show that our models are
competitive with traditional numerical schemes in the $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. In
particular, our neural networks approximate curvature with comparable precision
in coarse resolutions, when the interface features steep curvature regions, and
when the number of iterations to reinitialize the level-set function is small.
Although the conventional numerical approach is more robust than our framework,
our results have unveiled the potential of machine learning for dealing with
computational tasks where the level-set method is known to experience

http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0681v3,"A Local Spectral Method for Graphs: with Applications to Improving Graph
  Partitions and Exploring Data Graphs Locally","The second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and its associated eigenvector
are fundamental features of an undirected graph, and as such they have found
widespread use in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. In
many applications, however, graphs that arise have several \emph{local} regions
of interest, and the second eigenvector will typically fail to provide
information fine-tuned to each local region. In this paper, we introduce a
locally-biased analogue of the second eigenvector, and we demonstrate its
usefulness at highlighting local properties of data graphs in a semi-supervised
manner. To do so, we first view the second eigenvector as the solution to a
constrained optimization problem, and we incorporate the local information as
an additional constraint; we then characterize the optimal solution to this new
problem and show that it can be interpreted as a generalization of a
Personalized PageRank vector; and finally, as a consequence, we show that the
solution can be computed in nearly-linear time. In addition, we show that this
locally-biased vector can be used to compute an approximation to the best
partition \emph{near} an input seed set in a manner analogous to the way in
which the second eigenvector of the Laplacian can be used to obtain an
approximation to the best partition in the entire input graph. Such a primitive
is useful for identifying and refining clusters locally, as it allows us to
focus on a local region of interest in a semi-supervised manner. Finally, we
provide a detailed empirical evaluation of our method by showing how it can
applied to finding locally-biased sparse cuts around an input vertex seed set

  Italy","Monitoring advertising around controversial issues is an important step in
ensuring accountability and transparency of political processes. To that end,
we use the Facebook Ads Library to collect 2312 migration-related advertising
campaigns in Italy over one year. Our pro- and anti-immigration classifier
(F1=0.85) reveals a partisan divide among the major Italian political parties,
with anti-immigration ads accounting for nearly 15M impressions. Although
composing 47.6% of all migration-related ads, anti-immigration ones receive
65.2% of impressions. We estimate that about two thirds of all captured
campaigns use some kind of demographic targeting by location, gender, or age.
We find sharp divides by age and gender: for instance, anti-immigration ads
from major parties are 17% more likely to be seen by a male user than a female.
Unlike pro-migration parties, we find that anti-immigration ones reach a
similar demographic to their own voters. However their audience change with
topic: an ad from anti-immigration parties is 24% more likely to be seen by a
male user when the ad speaks about migration, than if it does not. Furthermore,
the viewership of such campaigns tends to follow the volume of mainstream news
around immigration, supporting the theory that political advertisers try to
""ride the wave"" of current news. We conclude with policy implications for
political communication: since the Facebook Ads Library does not allow to
distinguish between advertisers intentions and algorithmic targeting, we argue
that more details should be shared by platforms regarding the targeting

unconscious favoritism towards one gender over another [47] with respect to
professions and occupations. The objective of this work is to identify and

formalism, ATR, has its first-order programs characterize the polynomial-time
computable functions, and its second-order programs characterize the type-2
basic feasible functionals of Mehlhorn and of Cook and Urquhart. (The ATR-types
are confined to levels 0, 1, and 2.) The type system comes in two parts, one
that primarily restricts the sizes of values of expressions and a second that
primarily restricts the time required to evaluate expressions. The
size-restricted part is motivated by Bellantoni and Cook's and Leivant's
implicit characterizations of polynomial-time. The time-restricting part is an
affine version of Barber and Plotkin's DILL. Two semantics are constructed for
ATR. The first is a pruning of the naive denotational semantics for ATR. This
pruning removes certain functions that cause otherwise feasible forms of
recursion to go wrong. The second semantics is a model for ATR's time
complexity relative to a certain abstract machine. This model provides a
setting for complexity recurrences arising from ATR recursions, the solutions

matching in general graphs $G = (V, E)$. The best known algorithm for this
problem till date runs in $O(m \sqrt{n})$ time due to Micali and Vazirani
\cite{MV80}. Even for general bipartite graphs this is the best known running
time (the algorithm of Karp and Hopcroft \cite{HK73} also achieves this bound).
For regular bipartite graphs one can achieve an $O(m)$ time algorithm which,
following a series of papers, has been recently improved to $O(n \log n)$ by
Goel, Kapralov and Khanna (STOC 2010) \cite{GKK10}. In this paper we present a
randomized algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo paradigm which runs
in $O(m \log^2 n)$ time, thereby obtaining a significant improvement over
\cite{MV80}.
  We use a Markov chain similar to the \emph{hard-core model} for Glauber
Dynamics with \emph{fugacity} parameter $\lambda$, which is used to sample
independent sets in a graph from the Gibbs Distribution \cite{V99}, to design a
faster algorithm for finding maximum matchings in general graphs. Our result
crucially relies on the fact that the mixing time of our Markov Chain is
independent of $\lambda$, a significant deviation from the recent series of
works \cite{GGSVY11,MWW09, RSVVY10, S10, W06} which achieve computational
transition (for estimating the partition function) on a threshold value of
$\lambda$. As a result we are able to design a randomized algorithm which runs
in $O(m\log^2 n)$ time that provides a major improvement over the running time
of the algorithm due to Micali and Vazirani. Using the conductance bound, we

isomorphic if and only if they have the same left profile, that is, for every
graph $F$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ coincides with the
number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Dvor{\'{a}}k and later on Dell, Grohe,
and Rattan showed that restrictions of the left profile to a class of graphs
can capture several different relaxations of isomorphism, including equivalence
in counting logics with a fixed number of variables (which contains fractional
isomorphism as a special case) and co-spectrality (i.e., two graphs having the
same characteristic polynomial). On the other side, a result by Chaudhuri and
Vardi asserts that isomorphism is also captured by the right profile, that is,
two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if for every graph $F$, the
number of homomorphisms from $G$ to $F$ coincides with the number of
homomorphisms from $H$ to $F$. In this paper, we embark on a study of the
restrictions of the right profile by investigating relaxations of isomorphism
that can or cannot be captured by restricting the right profile to a fixed
class of graphs. Our results unveil striking differences between the expressive
power of the left profile and the right profile. We show that fractional
isomorphism, equivalence in counting logics with a fixed number of variables,
and co-spectrality cannot be captured by restricting the right profile to a
class of graphs. In the opposite direction, we show that chromatic equivalence

  Reduction","This paper investigates a novel a-posteriori variance reduction approach in
Monte Carlo image synthesis. Unlike most established methods based on lateral
filtering in the image space, our proposition is to produce the best possible
estimate for each pixel separately, from all the samples drawn for it. To
enable this, we systematically study the per-pixel sample distributions for
diverse scene configurations. Noting that these are too complex to be
characterized by standard statistical distributions (e.g. Gaussians), we
identify patterns recurring in them and exploit those for training a
variance-reduction model based on neural nets. In result, we obtain numerically
better estimates compared to simple averaging of samples. This method is
compatible with existing image-space denoising methods, as the improved
estimates of our model can be used for further processing. We conclude by

of pattern classification. A statistical formulation is given where we propose
to use data contamination to model and understand the phenomenon of image

as well, for example, measurement errors and gross errors etc. The impact of
data contamination on classification is studied under a statistical learning
theoretical framework. A closed-form asymptotic bound is established for the
resulting loss in classification accuracy, which is less than
$\epsilon/(1-\epsilon)$ for data contamination of an amount of $\epsilon$. Our
bound is sharper than similar bounds in the domain adaptation literature and,
unlike such bounds, it applies to classifiers with an infinite
Vapnik-Chervonekis (VC) dimension. Extensive simulations have been conducted on
both synthetic and real datasets under various types of data contamination,

function approximations (VFAs) to obtain policies and lower bounds on the
optimal policy cost of discounted-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs).
Formulating an ALP requires (i) basis functions, the linear combination of
which defines the VFA, and (ii) a state-relevance distribution, which
determines the relative importance of different states in the ALP objective for
the purpose of minimizing VFA error. Both these choices are typically
heuristic: basis function selection relies on domain knowledge while the
state-relevance distribution is specified using the frequency of states visited
by a heuristic policy. We propose a self-guided sequence of ALPs that embeds
random basis functions obtained via inexpensive sampling and uses the known VFA
from the previous iteration to guide VFA computation in the current iteration.
Self-guided ALPs mitigate the need for domain knowledge during basis function
selection as well as the impact of the initial choice of the state-relevance
distribution, thus significantly reducing the ALP implementation burden. We
establish high probability error bounds on the VFAs from this sequence and show
that a worst-case measure of policy performance is improved. We find that these
favorable implementation and theoretical properties translate to encouraging
numerical results on perishable inventory control and options pricing
applications, where self-guided ALP policies improve upon policies from
problem-specific methods. More broadly, our research takes a meaningful step

automatically analysed: we can systematically deal with (a) honest authorities
present in different phases, (b) threat models in which no dishonest voters
occur, and (c) protocols whose ballot secrecy depends on fresh data coming from
other phases. The second advantage is that it can significantly improve
verification efficiency, as the individual conditions are often simpler to
verify. E.g., for the LEE protocol, we obtain a speedup of over two orders of

subject in terms of outfit, suggesting scenarios where people do not change
their attire. In this paper we overcome this restriction, by proposing a
framework based on a deep convolutional neural network, SOMAnet, that
additionally models other discriminative aspects, namely, structural attributes
of the human figure (e.g. height, obesity, gender). Our method is unique in
many respects. First, SOMAnet is based on the Inception architecture, departing
from the usual siamese framework. This spares expensive data preparation
(pairing images across cameras) and allows the understanding of what the
network learned. Second, and most notably, the training data consists of a
synthetic 100K instance dataset, SOMAset, created by photorealistic human body
generation software. Synthetic data represents a good compromise between
realistic imagery, usually not required in re-identification since surveillance
cameras capture low-resolution silhouettes, and complete control of the
samples, which is useful in order to customize the data w.r.t. the surveillance
scenario at-hand, e.g. ethnicity. SOMAnet, trained on SOMAset and fine-tuned on

their bids only for bundles in $\Sigma$. The $\Sigma$-VC combinatorial auctions
(multi-good auctions) obtained in this way are known to be

with non-restricted VC auctions, in which the buyers restrict themselves to
bids on bundles in $\Sigma$, because it is rational for them to do so. That is,
it may be that when the buyers report their valuation of the bundles in
$\Sigma$, they are in an equilibrium. We fully characterize those $\Sigma$ that
induce individually rational equilibrium in every VC auction, and we refer to
the associated equilibrium as a bundling equilibrium. The number of bundles in
$\Sigma$ represents the communication complexity of the equilibrium. A special
case of bundling equilibrium is partition-based equilibrium, in which $\Sigma$

project continuous grayscale images onto the surrounding walls. Given the
geometry of the lampshade and a target grayscale image, our method computes a
distribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of
the light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse
surface. Our objective is to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial
detail of the target image, to the extent possible within the constraints of
the fabrication process.
  To ensure structural integrity, there are lower bounds on the thickness of
the shell, the radii of the holes, and the minimal distances between adjacent
holes. Thus, the holes are realized as thin tubes distributed over the
lampshade surface. The amount of light passing through a single tube may be
controlled by the tube's radius and by its direction (tilt angle). The core of
our technique thus consists of determining a suitable configuration of the
tubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well
as the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by
computing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined
density function, and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of
each tessellation cell. The density function for a particular target image is
derived from a series of simulated images, each corresponding to a different

  hydrodynamic urban drainage simulators","Many model based scientific and engineering methodologies, such as system
identification, sensitivity analysis, optimization and control, require a large
number of model evaluations. In particular, model based real-time control of
urban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast
prediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter
values. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this
application. Fast surrogate models, so-called emulators, provide a solution to
this efficiency demand. Emulators are attractive, because they sacrifice
unneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to
predict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some emulators fail to
extrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are
many strategies for developing emulators, up until now the selection of the
emulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the
performance of two families of emulators for open channel flows in the context
of urban drainage simulators. We compare emulators that explicitly use
knowledge of the simulator's equations, i.e. mechanistic emulators based on
Gaussian Processes, with purely data-driven emulators using matrix
factorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive
data-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. Nevertheless, we
discuss scenarios in which we think that mechanistic emulation might be
favorable for i) extrapolation in time and ii) dealing with sparse and unevenly

extracting relevant DDI signals from either the published literature or large

mining is the automatic identification of a large number of potential DDIs,

via in vitro pharmacology and in populo pharmaco-epidemiology. Experiments. We
implemented a set of classifiers for identifying published articles relevant to
experimental pharmacokinetic DDI evidence. These documents are important for
identifying causal mechanisms behind putative drug-drug interactions, an
important step in the extraction of large numbers of potential DDIs. We

dictionary becomes thus the first resource to combine large-scale spontaneous
translation with phonetic transcriptions. Moreover, we control for the regional
distribution and insure the equal representation of the major Swiss dialects.

show that they are sufficient to train a Transformer-based phoneme to grapheme
model that generates credible novel Swiss German writings. In addition, we show
that the inverse mapping - from graphemes to phonemes - can be modeled with a

  Recognition Using Spiking Neural Networks Trained with STDP","There has been an increasing interest in spiking neural networks in recent
years. SNNs are seen as hypothetical solutions for the bottlenecks of ANNs in
pattern recognition, such as energy efficiency. But current methods such as
ANN-to-SNN conversion and back-propagation do not take full advantage of these
networks, and unsupervised methods have not yet reached a success comparable to
advanced artificial neural networks. It is important to study the behavior of
SNNs trained with unsupervised learning methods such as spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) on video classification tasks, including mechanisms to model
motion information using spikes, as this information is critical for video
understanding. This paper presents multiple methods of transposing temporal
information into a static format, and then transforming the visual information
into spikes using latency coding. These methods are paired with two types of
temporal fusion known as early and late fusion, and are used to help the
spiking neural network in capturing the spatio-temporal features from videos.
In this paper, we rely on the network architecture of a convolutional spiking
neural network trained with STDP, and we test the performance of this network
when challenged with action recognition tasks. Understanding how a spiking
neural network responds to different methods of movement extraction and
representation can help reduce the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. In

select k points such that the average Euclidean distance between these points
is maximized. This problem commonly appears in information retrieval and
web-search in order to select a diverse set of points from the input. In this
context, it has recently received a lot of attention.
  We present new techniques to analyze natural local search algorithms. This
leads to a (1-O(1/k))-approximation for distances of negative type, even
subject to any matroid constraint of rank k, in time O(n k^2 log k), when
assuming that distance evaluations and calls to the independence oracle are
constant time. Negative type distances include as special cases Euclidean
distances and many further natural distances. Our result easily transforms into
a PTAS and improves on the only previously known PTAS for this setting, which
relies on convex optimization techniques in an n-dimensional space and is
impractical for large data sets. In contrast, our procedure has an (optimal)
linear dependence on n.
  Using generalized exchange properties of matroid intersection, we show that a

consumers when making purchases. Though it is becoming more and more difficult
for people to make well-informed buying decisions without being deceived by
fake reviews. Prior works on the opinion spam problem mostly considered
classifying fake reviews using behavioral user patterns. They focused on
prolific users who write more than a couple of reviews, discarding one-time
reviewers. The number of singleton reviewers however is expected to be high for
many review websites. While behavioral patterns are effective when dealing with
elite users, for one-time reviewers, the review text needs to be exploited. In
this paper we tackle the problem of detecting fake reviews written by the same
person using multiple names, posting each review under a different name. We
propose two methods to detect similar reviews and show the results generally
outperform the vectorial similarity measures used in prior works. The first
method extends the semantic similarity between words to the reviews level. The
second method is based on topic modeling and exploits the similarity of the
reviews topic distributions using two models: bag-of-words and
bag-of-opinion-phrases. The experiments were conducted on reviews from three

advantage over classic techniques for estimating human policies is the
transferability of the inferred objectives: Behaviour can be predicted in
variations of the control task by policy computation using a relaxed optimality
criterion. However, exact policy inference is often computationally intractable
in control problems with imperfect state observation. In this work, we present
a model class that allows modelling human control of two tasks of which only
one be perfectly observed at a time requiring attention switching. We show how

hypothesis as output. A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite
number of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that
determine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these
other factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms
have a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning
algorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis.
Algorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as
classical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has
implications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The
Baldwin effect was proposed in 1896, to explain how phenomena that might appear
to require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can
arise from purely Darwinian evolution. Hinton and Nowlan presented a
computational model of the Baldwin effect in 1987. We explore a variation on
their model, which we constructed explicitly to illustrate the lessons that the
Baldwin effect has for research in bias shifting algorithms. The main lesson is
that it appears that a good strategy for shift of bias in a learning algorithm

converting arbitrary PDAs accepting ultralinear languages to finite-turn PDAs
cannot be bounded by any recursive function. The latter phenomenon is known as
non-recursive trade-off. In this paper, finite-turn PDAs accepting bounded
languages are considered. First, letter-bounded languages are studied. We prove
that in this case the non-recursive trade-off is reduced to a recursive
trade-off, more precisely, to an exponential trade-off. A conversion algorithm
is presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by proving tight
lower bounds. Furthermore, the question of reducing the number of turns of a

project management level are often mistakenly pointing to symptoms of failure
rather than a project's underlying socio-complexity (complexity resulting from
the interactions of people and groups) which is usually the actual source of
failure. We propose a novel method, Stakeholder Impact Analysis, that can be
used to identify risks associated with socio-complexity as it is grounded in
insights from the social sciences, psychology and management science. This
paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Stakeholder Impact Analysis by using
the 1992 London Ambulance Service Computer Aided Dispatch project as a case
study, and shows that had our method been used to identify the risks and had
they been mitigated, it would have reduced the risk of project failure. This

by n selfish nodes. Each node v can buy a set of edges, each for a fixed price
\alpha > 0. Its goal is to minimize its private costs, i.e., the sum (SUM-game,
Fabrikant et al., PODC 2003) or maximum (MAX-game, Demaine et al., PODC 2007)
of distances from $v$ to all other nodes plus the prices of the bought edges.
The above papers show the existence of Nash equilibria as well as upper and
lower bounds for the prices of anarchy and stability. In several subsequent
papers, these bounds were improved for a wide range of prices \alpha. In this
paper, we extend these models by incorporating quality-of-service aspects: Each
edge cannot only be bought at a fixed quality (edge length one) for a fixed
price \alpha. Instead, we assume that quality levels (i.e., edge lengths) are
varying in a fixed interval [\beta,B], 0 < \beta <= B. A node now cannot only
choose which edge to buy, but can also choose its quality x, for the price
p(x), for a given price function p. For both games and all price functions, we
show that Nash equilibria exist and that the price of stability is either
constant or depends only on the interval size of available edge lengths. Our
main results are bounds for the price of anarchy. In case of the SUM-game, we

NP-complete to test whether a given triangulated model can be represented as a

applies a dual graph matching algorithm to partition the mesh into cycles, and
then merges pairs of cycles by splitting adjacent triangles when necessary. New
vertices are introduced at midpoints of edges and the new triangles thus formed
are coplanar with their parent triangles, hence the visual fidelity of the
geometry is not changed. We prove that the increase in the number of triangles

tested the increase was less than 2%. We also prove tight bounds on the number

calculus S'_{gamma}. The calculus employs a many-sorted type system extended by
designated generic strategy types gamma. We consider two generic strategy
types, namely the types of type-preserving and type-unifying strategies.
S'_{gamma} offers traversal combinators to construct traversals or schemes
thereof from many-sorted and generic strategies. The traversal combinators
model different forms of one-step traversal, that is, they process the
immediate subterms of a given term without anticipating any scheme of recursion
into terms. To inhabit generic types, we need to add a fundamental combinator
to lift a many-sorted strategy $s$ to a generic type gamma. This step is called
strategy extension. The semantics of the corresponding combinator states that s
is only applied if the type of the term at hand fits, otherwise the extended
strategy fails. This approach dictates that the semantics of strategy
application must be type-dependent to a certain extent. Typed strategic term
rewriting with coverage of generic term traversal is a simple but expressive
model of generic programming. It has applications in program transformation and
program analysis.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

of 1 billion documents in 2002. Most of the documents are Web pages whose data
is considered to be in XML format, expecting it to eventually replace HTML.
  A common problem in designing and maintaining a Web site is that data on a
Web page often replicates or derives from other data, the so-called base data,
that is usually not contained in the deriving or replicating page.
Consequently, replicas and derivations become inconsistent upon modifying base
data in a Web page or a relational database. For example, after assigning a
thesis to a student and modifying the Web page that describes it in detail, the
thesis is still incorrectly contained in the list of offered thesis, missing in
the list of ongoing thesis, and missing in the advisor's teaching record.
  The thesis presents a solution by proposing a combined approach that provides
for maintaining consistency of data in Web pages that (i) replicate data in
relational databases, or (ii) replicate or derive from data in Web pages. Upon
modifying base data, the modification is immediately pushed to affected Web
pages. There, maintenance is performed incrementally by only modifying the
affected part of the page instead of re-generating the whole page from scratch.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Separation of Cut Versus Spectral Sparsification","We prove that a random $d$-regular graph, with high probability, is a cut
sparsifier of the clique with approximation error at most $\left(2\sqrt{\frac 2
\pi} + o_{n,d}(1)\right)/\sqrt d$, where $2\sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} = 1.595\ldots$
and $o_{n,d}(1)$ denotes an error term that depends on $n$ and $d$ and goes to
zero if we first take the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and then the limit $d
\rightarrow \infty$.
  This is established by analyzing linear-size cuts using techniques of
Jagannath and Sen derived from ideas in statistical physics, and analyzing
small cuts via martingale inequalities.
  We also prove new lower bounds on spectral sparsification of the clique. If
$G$ is a spectral sparsifier of the clique and $G$ has average degree $d$, we
prove that the approximation error is at least the ""Ramanujan bound''
$(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, which is met by $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs,
provided that either the weighted adjacency matrix of $G$ is a (multiple of) a
doubly stochastic matrix, or that $G$ satisfies a certain high ""odd
pseudo-girth"" property. The first case can be seen as an ""Alon-Boppana theorem
for symmetric doubly stochastic matrices,"" showing that a symmetric doubly
stochastic matrix with $dn$ non-zero entries has a non-trivial eigenvalue of
magnitude at least $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$; the second case generalizes a
lower bound of Srivastava and Trevisan, which requires a large girth
assumption.
  Together, these results imply a separation between spectral sparsification
and cut sparsification. If $G$ is a random $\log n$-regular graph on $n$
vertices, we show that, with high probability, $G$ admits a (weighted subgraph)
cut sparsifier of average degree $d$ and approximation error at most

a primary method for determining near-native, near-atomic resolution 3D
structures of biological macromolecules. In order to meet increasing demand for
cryo-EM, automated methods to improve throughput and efficiency while lowering
costs are needed. Currently, all high-magnification cryo-EM data collection
softwares require human input and manual tuning of parameters. Expert operators
must navigate low- and medium-magnification images to find good
high-magnification collection locations. Automating this is non-trivial: the
images suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and are affected by a range of
experimental parameters that can differ for each collection session. Here, we
use various computer vision algorithms, including mixture models, convolutional
neural networks, and U-Nets to develop the first pipeline to automate low- and
medium-magnification targeting. Learned models in this pipeline are trained on
a large internal dataset of images from real world cryo-EM data collection
sessions, labeled with locations that were selected by operators. Using these
models, we show that we can effectively detect and classify regions of interest
in low- and medium-magnification images, and can generalize to unseen sessions,
as well as to images captured using different microscopes from external

challenging, not least because the behaviour happens within computers and
communications networks, but also because data traffic speeds and volumes are
beyond human ability to process. Visualisation is widely used to present
information about the dynamics of network traffic dynamics. Although it
provides operators with an overall view and specific information about
particular traffic or attacks on the network, it often fails to represent the
events in an understandable way. Visualisations require visual attention and so
are not well suited to continuous monitoring scenarios in which network
administrators must carry out other tasks. Situational awareness is critical
and essential for decision-making in the domain of computer network monitoring
where it is vital to be able to identify and recognize network environment
behaviours.Here we present SoNSTAR (Sonification of Networks for SiTuational
AwaReness), a real-time sonification system to be used in the monitoring of
computer networks to support the situational awareness of network
administrators. SoNSTAR provides an auditory representation of all the TCP/IP
protocol traffic within a network based on the different traffic flows between
between network hosts. SoNSTAR raises situational awareness levels for computer
network defence by allowing operators to achieve better understanding and
performance while imposing less workload compared to visual techniques. SoNSTAR
identifies the features of network traffic flows by inspecting the status flags

one of the most popular social bookmarking sites that uses folksonomy.
  Usage of folksonomy, although very easy, also has its weaknesses, such as use
of different tags for the same concept, use of the same tag for different
concepts, no quality control, etc. We try to provide a solution for some of
these problems by analyzing Web documents' contents and categorizing them
automatically using multinomial naive Bayes algorithm.
  Bayes classifier works by using a set of evidences and a set of classes. By
training the system using sample data, we can determine the probability of an
evidence given a particular class. Bayes classifier also uses prior probability
of a class, which can be calculated from sample data. From these analysis, when
given a new document which is formed by a set of evidences (words), the
probabilities of each class given that document (posterior probabilities) can
be determined.
  This system is implemented using PHP 5, Apache, and MySQL. The conclusion
from building this system is that the Bayes method can be used to automatically
categorize documents and also as an assistive tool for manual categorization.

computation in such a way that each party's input and output remain private to
that party. Whereas MPC protocols for specific computations have existed since

MPC on arbitrary functions. Yet, using today's MPC compilers requires
substantial programming effort and skill on the user's side, among other things
because nearly all compilers translate the code of the computation into a

that the optimal non-equilibrium state to which the engine should be driven

universal compression supposes that the distribution of the random variable,

descriptions for the random variable are agnostic to the identity of the
distribution in $\cal P$. But because they are not matched exactly to the
underlying distribution of the random variable, the average number of bits they
use is higher, and the excess over the entropy used is the ""redundancy"". This
formulation is fundamental to problems not just in compression, but also
estimation and prediction and has a wide variety of applications from language
modeling to insurance.
  In this paper, we study the redundancy of universal encodings of strings
generated by independent identically distributed (iid) sampling from a set
$\cal P$ of distributions over a countable support. We first show that if
describing a single sample from $\cal P$ incurs finite redundancy, then $\cal
P$ is tight but that the converse does not always hold. If a single sample can
be described with finite worst-case-regret (a more stringent formulation than
redundancy above), then it is known that length-$n$ iid samples only incurs a
diminishing (in $n$) redundancy per symbol as $n$ increases. However, we show
it is possible that a collection $\cal P$ incurs finite redundancy, yet

i) continuous monitoring of multivariate variables and non-uniform sampling of

  Restrictions on Inclusions","We consider the problem of allocating a set $I$ of $m$ indivisible resources
(items) to a set $P$ of $n$ customers (players) competing for the resources.
Each resource $j \in I$ has a same value $v_j > 0$ for a subset of customers
interested in $j$, and zero value for the remaining customers. The utility
received by each customer is the sum of the values of the resources allocated
to her. The goal is to find a feasible allocation of the resources to the
interested customers such that for the Max-Min allocation problem (Min-Max
allocation problem) the minimum of the utilities (maximum of the utilities)
received by the customers is maximized (minimized). The Max-Min allocation
problem is also known as the \textit{Fair Allocation problem}, or the
\textit{Santa Claus problem}. The Min-Max allocation problem is the problem of
Scheduling on Unrelated Parallel Machines, and is also known as the $R \, | \,
| C_{\max}$ problem.
  In this paper, we are interested in instances of the problem that admit a
Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS). We show that an ordering property
on the resources and the customers is important and paves the way for a PTAS.
For the Max-Min allocation problem, we start with instances of the problem that
can be viewed as a \textit{convex bipartite graph}; a bipartite graph for which
there exists an ordering of the resources such that each customer is interested
in (has a positive evaluation for) a set of \textit{consecutive} resources. We
demonstrate a PTAS for the inclusion-free cases. This class of instances is

geometric objects are defined by implicit relations involving sets. An
important member in this family is called ""a zone diagram"". The implicit nature
of zone diagrams implies, as already observed in the original works, that their
computation is a challenging task. In a continuous setting this task has been
addressed (briefly) only by these authors in the Euclidean plane with point
sites. We discuss the possibility to compute zone diagrams in a wide class of
spaces and also shed new light on their computation in the original setting.
The class of spaces, which is introduced here, includes, in particular,
Euclidean spheres and finite dimensional strictly convex normed spaces. Sites
of a general form are allowed and it is shown that a generalization of the
iterative method suggested by Asano, Matousek and Tokuyama converges to a
double zone diagram, another implicit geometric object whose existence is known
in general. Occasionally a zone diagram can be obtained from this procedure.
The actual (approximate) computation of the iterations is based on a simple
algorithm which enables the approximate computation of Voronoi diagrams in a
general setting. Our analysis also yields a few byproducts of independent

algorithm up to the minimal distance. Our new polynomial-time list decoding
algorithm uses sub-sequences of the received evaluations indexed by a linear
progression, allowing the decoding for a larger radius, that is, more errors in
the evaluations while returning a list of candidate sparse polynomials. We
quantify this improvement for all typically small values of number of terms and
number of errors, and provide a worst case asymptotic analysis of this
improvement. For instance, for sparsity T = 5 with up to 10 errors we can list
decode in polynomial-time from 74 values of the polynomial with unknown terms,

semantics of SC atomic operations and fences in the C11 and OpenCL memory
models is subtle, leading to convoluted prose descriptions that translate to
complex axiomatic formalisations. We conduct an overhaul of SC atomics in C11,
reducing the associated axioms in both number and complexity. A consequence of
our simplification is that the SC operations in an execution no longer need to
be totally ordered. This relaxation enables, for the first time, efficient and
exhaustive simulation of litmus tests that use SC atomics. We extend our
improved C11 model to obtain the first rigorous memory model formalisation for
OpenCL (which extends C11 with support for heterogeneous many-core
programming). In the OpenCL setting, we refine the SC axioms still further to
give a sensible semantics to SC operations that employ a 'memory scope' to
restrict their visibility to specific threads. Our overhaul requires slight
strengthenings of both the C11 and the OpenCL memory models, causing some
behaviours to become disallowed. We argue that these strengthenings are
natural, and that all of the formalised C11 and OpenCL compilation schemes of
which we are aware (Power and x86 CPUs for C11, AMD GPUs for OpenCL) remain
valid in our revised models. Using the Herd memory model simulator, we show

cracked by attackers, password-based authentication remains the most
widely-used method. To encourage users to select good passwords, enterprises
often enforce policies. Such policies have been proven to be ineffectual in
practice. Accurate assessment of a password's resistance to cracking attacks is
still an unsolved problem, and our work addresses this challenge. Although the
best way to determine how difficult it may be to crack a user-selected password
is to check its resistance to cracking attacks employed by attackers in the
wild, implementing such a strategy at an enterprise would be infeasible in
practice. We first formalize the concepts of password complexity and strength
with concrete definitions emphasizing their differences. Our framework captures
human biases and many known techniques attackers use to recover stolen
credentials in real life, such as brute-force attacks. Building on our
definitions, we develop a general framework for calculating password complexity
and strength that could be used in practice. Our approach is based on the key

introduced as a formalization of a computation model that restricts random
access to external memory and internal memory space. Here, each of the tapes

device, and the tapes of restricted size model internal memory. We use
ST(r(n),s(n),O(1)) to denote the class of all problems that can be solved by
deterministic Turing machines that comply to the above resource bounds.
Similarly, NST and RST, respectively, are used for the corresponding

projection of multiple patterns results in their superposition in the

structured-light vision based on projector-camera triangulation. By analyzing
the behavior of superposed-light colors in a chromaticity domain, we show that
the original light colors cannot be properly extracted by the conventional

polynomially bounded by |y|), an interval size function of A returns, for each
string x in the universe, the number of strings in the interval between strings

polynomial-time computable in the length of x.
  By choosing sets of interval size functions based on feasibility requirements
for their underlying p-orders, we obtain new characterizations of complexity
classes. We prove that the set of all interval size functions whose underlying
p-orders are polynomial-time decidable is exactly #P. We show that the interval
size functions for orders with polynomial-time adjacency checks are closely
related to the class FPSPACE(poly). Indeed, FPSPACE(poly) is exactly the class
of all nonnegative functions that are an interval size function minus a
polynomial-time computable function.
  We study two important functions in relation to interval size functions. The
function #DIV maps each natural number n to the number of nontrivial divisors
of n. We show that #DIV is an interval size function of a polynomial-time
decidable partial p-order with polynomial-time adjacency checks. The function
#MONSAT maps each monotone boolean formula F to the number of satisfying

Vertex Sparsifiers, i.e., sparsifiers whose goal is to reduce the number of
vertices. We focus on the following notions:
  (1) Given a digraph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K \subset V$ with $|K| =
k$, a (vertex) reachability sparsifier of $G$ is a digraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$, $K
\subset V_H$ that preserves all reachability information among terminal pairs.
In this work we introduce the notion of reachability-preserving minors (RPMs) ,
i.e., we require $H$ to be a minor of $G$. We show any directed graph $G$
admits a RPM $H$ of size $O(k^3)$, and if $G$ is planar, then the size of $H$
improves to $O(k^{2} \log k)$. We complement our upper-bound by showing that
there exists an infinite family of grids such that any RPM must have
$\Omega(k^{2})$ vertices.
  (2) Given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and terminal vertices $K$
with $|K|=k$, an exact (vertex) cut sparsifier of $G$ is a graph $H$ with $K
\subset V_H$ that preserves the value of minimum-cuts separating any
bipartition of $K$. We show that planar graphs with all the $k$ terminals lying
on the same face admit exact cut sparsifiers of size $O(k^{2})$ that are also
planar. Our result extends to flow and distance sparsifiers. It improves the
previous best-known bound of $O(k^22^{2k})$ for cut and flow sparsifiers by an

be a bridge between all Lumen intelligence modules with NAO robot, and to be
the communication bridge between those Lumen intelligence modules. For the
second function, Lumen Server implements the AMQP protocol using RabbitMQ.
Besides that, writer also developed a control system for robot movement called
Lumen Motion. Lumen motion is implemented by modelling the movement of NAO
robot and also by creating a control system using fuzzy logic controller.
Writer also developed a program that connects all Lumen intelligence modules so
that Lumen can act like a tour guide. The implementation of this program uses
FSM and event-driven program. From implementation result, all the features
which were designed are successfully implemented. By the developing of this
computational platform, it can ease the development of Lumen in the future. For
next development, it must be focused on creating integration system so that
Lumen can be more responsive to the environment.

parallel programs. However, the two composition constructs, i.e. ""$\parallel$""
(parallel) and ""$;$"" (serial), are insufficient in expressing ""partial

composition construct ""$\leadsto$"" to express partial dependencies in
algorithms in a processor- and cache-oblivious way, thus extending the Nested
Parallel (NP) model to the \emph{Nested Dataflow} (ND) model. We redesign
several divide-and-conquer algorithms ranging from dense linear algebra to
dynamic-programming in the ND model and prove that they all have optimal span
while retaining optimal cache complexity. We propose the design of runtime
schedulers that map ND programs to multicore processors with multiple levels of
possibly shared caches (i.e, Parallel Memory Hierarchies) and provide
theoretical guarantees on their ability to preserve locality and load balance.
For this, we adapt space-bounded (SB) schedulers for the ND model. We show that
our algorithms have increased ""parallelizability"" in the ND model, and that SB
schedulers can use the extra parallelizability to achieve asymptotically
optimal bounds on cache misses and running time on a greater number of
processors than in the NP model. The running time for the algorithms in this

of continuous Deep Implicit Fields. They allow for detailed modeling of
watertight surfaces of arbitrary topology while not relying on a 3D Euclidean
grid, resulting in a learnable parameterization that is not limited in

  Unfortunately, these methods are often not suitable for applications that
require an explicit mesh-based surface representation because converting an
implicit field to such a representation relies on the Marching Cubes algorithm,
which cannot be differentiated with respect to the underlying implicit field.
  In this work, we remove this limitation and introduce a differentiable way to
produce explicit surface mesh representations from Deep Signed Distance
Functions. Our key insight is that by reasoning on how implicit field
perturbations impact local surface geometry, one can ultimately differentiate
the 3D location of surface samples with respect to the underlying deep implicit
field. We exploit this to define MeshSDF, an end-to-end differentiable mesh
representation which can vary its topology.

2-choice balls-into-bins process, where the bins correspond to vertices of an
arbitrary underlying graph $G$. At each time step an edge of $G$ is chosen
uniformly at random, and a ball must be assigned to either of the two endpoints
of this edge. The standard 2-choice process corresponds to the case of $G=K_n$.
  For any $k(n)$-edge-connected, $d(n)$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, and any
number of balls, we give an allocation strategy that, with high probability,
ensures a gap of $O((d/k) \log^4\hspace{-1pt}n \log \log n)$, between the load
of any two bins. In particular, this implies polylogarithmic bounds for natural
graphs such as cycles and tori, for which the classical greedy allocation
strategy is conjectured to have a polynomial gap between the bin loads. For
every graph $G$, we also show an $\Omega((d/k) + \log n)$ lower bound on the
gap achievable by any allocation strategy. This implies that our strategy
achieves the optimal gap, up to polylogarithmic factors, for every graph $G$.
  Our allocation algorithm is simple to implement and requires only
$O(\log(n))$ time per allocation. It can be viewed as a more global version of
the greedy strategy that compares average load on certain fixed sets of

World Wide Web (WWW) is a major scientific and technological challenge. This
has been tackled recently by characterizing the properties of its
representative graphs in which vertices and directed edges are identified with
web-pages and hyperlinks, respectively. Data gathered in large scale crawls
have been analyzed by several groups resulting in a general picture of the WWW
that encompasses many of the complex properties typical of rapidly evolving
networks. In this paper, we report a detailed statistical analysis of the
topological properties of four different WWW graphs obtained with different
crawlers. We find that, despite the very large size of the samples, the
statistical measures characterizing these graphs differ quantitatively, and in
some cases qualitatively, depending on the domain analyzed and the crawl used
for gathering the data. This spurs the issue of the presence of sampling biases
and structural differences of Web crawls that might induce properties not
representative of the actual global underlying graph. In order to provide a
more accurate characterization of the Web graph and identify observables which
are clearly discriminating with respect to the sampling process, we study the
behavior of degree-degree correlation functions and the statistics of
reciprocal connections. The latter appears to enclose the relevant correlations
of the WWW graph and carry most of the topological information of theWeb. The
analysis of this quantity is also of major interest in relation to the
navigability and searchability of the Web.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

equivalence allows for many known theoretical insights for SVM and Lasso to be
translated between the two settings. One such implication gives a simple
kernelized version of the Lasso, analogous to the kernels used in the SVM

to the number of support vectors for the corresponding SVM instance, and that
one can use screening rules to prune the set of support vectors. Furthermore,

with the costs and benefits of lifetime learning by individuals in an evolving

there is much to be gained from attention to the costs. This paper explains the
two sides of the story and enumerates ten of the costs and benefits of lifetime
learning by individuals in an evolving population. Secondly, there is a cluster
of misunderstandings about the relationship between the Baldwin effect and
Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect is not

designers use intuition about the symmetry of the algorithm to design time and
communication-efficient schedules that map the algorithm to the machine. Is
there a systematic procedure for designing schedules? We present a new
technique to design schedules for algorithms with no non-trivial dependencies,
focusing on the classical matrix multiplication algorithm.
  We model the symmetry of algorithm with the set of instructions $X$ as the
action of the group formed by the compositions of bijections from the set $X$
to itself. We model the machine as the action of the group $N\times \Delta$,
where $N$ and $\Delta$ represent the interconnect topology and time increments
respectively, on the set $P\times T$ of processors iterated over time steps. We
model schedules as symmetry-preserving equivariant maps between the set $X$ and
a subgroup of its symmetry and the set $P\times T$ with the symmetry
$N\times\Delta$. Such equivariant maps are the solutions of a set of algebraic
equations involving group homomorphisms. We associate time and communication
costs with the solutions to these equations.
  We solve these equations for the classical matrix multiplication algorithm
and show that equivariant maps correspond to time- and communication-efficient
schedules for many topologies. We recover well known variants including the
Cannon's algorithm and the communication-avoiding ""2.5D"" algorithm for toroidal

algorithms for fat-trees, the cache-oblivious algorithm for the ideal cache

an instance $I$ of size $N$ over a universe $U_I$ of size $n$ and the task is
to check whether the universe contains a subset with property $\Phi$ (e.g.,
$\Phi$ could be the property of being a feedback vertex set for the input graph
of size at most $k$). Our main tool is a simple randomized algorithm which
solves $\Phi$-Subset in time $(1+b-\frac{1}{c})^n N^{O(1)}$, provided that
there is an algorithm for the $\Phi$-Extension problem with running time
$b^{n-|X|} c^k N^{O(1)}$. Here, the input for $\Phi$-Extension is an instance
$I$ of size $N$ over a universe $U_I$ of size $n$, a subset $X\subseteq U_I$,
and an integer $k$, and the task is to check whether there is a set $Y$ with
$X\subseteq Y \subseteq U_I$ and $|Y\setminus X|\le k$ with property $\Phi$. We
derandomize this algorithm at the cost of increasing the running time by a
subexponential factor in $n$, and we adapt it to the enumeration setting where
we need to enumerate all subsets of the universe with property $\Phi$. This
generalizes the results of Fomin et al. [STOC 2016] who proved the case where
$b=1$. As case studies, we use these results to design faster deterministic
algorithms for: - checking whether a graph has a feedback vertex set of size at

minimal vertex covers of size at most $k$, and - enumerating all minimal
3-hitting sets. We obtain these results by deriving new $b^{n-|X|} c^k

enumeration variant). In some cases, this is done by adapting the analysis of

  Convolutional Feature Maps","Instance retrieval requires one to search for images that contain a
particular object within a large corpus. Recent studies show that using image
features generated by pooling convolutional layer feature maps (CFMs) of a
pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to promising performance
for this task. However, due to the global pooling strategy adopted in those
works, the generated image feature is less robust to image clutter and tends to
be contaminated by the irrelevant image patterns. In this article, we alleviate
this drawback by proposing a novel reranking algorithm using CFMs to refine the
retrieval result obtained by existing methods. Our key idea, called query
adaptive matching (QAM), is to first represent the CFMs of each image by a set
of base regions which can be freely combined into larger regions-of-interest.
Then the similarity between the query and a candidate image is measured by the
best similarity score that can be attained by comparing the query feature and
the feature pooled from a combined region. We show that the above procedure can
be cast as an optimization problem and it can be solved efficiently with an
off-the-shelf solver. Besides this general framework, we also propose two
practical ways to create the base regions. One is based on the property of the
CFM and the other one is based on a multi-scale spatial pyramid scheme. Through

be envy-proof if each player cannot gain a competitive edge with respect to the
change in utility over the other players by deviation. Together with Nash
equilibrium and another stability notion called immunity, we show how these

failures and sector failures, both of which are prevalent in the field.
However, traditional erasure codes employ device-level redundancy to protect
against sector failures, and hence incur significant space overhead. Recent
sector-disk (SD) codes are available only for limited configurations. By making
a relaxed but practical assumption, we construct a general family of erasure
codes called \emph{STAIR codes}, which efficiently and provably tolerate both
device and sector failures without any restriction on the size of a storage
array and the numbers of tolerable device failures and sector failures. We
propose the \emph{upstairs encoding} and \emph{downstairs encoding} methods,
which provide complementary performance advantages for different
configurations. We conduct extensive experiments on STAIR codes in terms of
space saving, encoding/decoding speed, and update cost. We demonstrate that
STAIR codes not only improve space efficiency over traditional erasure codes,
but also provide better computational efficiency than SD codes based on our
special code construction. Finally, we present analytical models that
characterize the reliability of STAIR codes, and show that the support of a

Advertisers have a set of keywords (""targets"") and some stochastic information

that the strategies of other players are fixed. Then, the best response can be

computer installations is considered. This problem emerges with orchestration
and provisioning a virtual infrastructure in a cloud computing environment over
a heterogeneous network of computer installations: supercomputers or clusters
of servers (e.g. mini data centers). One of the key criteria for the
effectiveness of the cloud computing environment is the time staying by the
program inside the environment. This time consists of the waiting time in the
queue and the execution time on the selected physical computer installation, to
which the computational resource of the virtual infrastructure is dynamically
mapped. One of the components of this problem is the estimation of the MPI
programs execution time on a certain set of computer installations. This is
necessary to determine a proper choice of order and place for program
execution. The article proposes two new approaches to the program execution
time prediction problem. The first one is based on computer installations
grouping based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. The second one is based
on vector representations of computer installations and MPI programs, so-called
embeddings. The embedding technique is actively used in recommendation systems,

be modeled as functional optimization problems over a graph. In this
formulation, all vertices and arcs of the graph are functionals; i.e., a
mapping from a space of measurable functions to the field of real numbers. Many
variants of the TSP, such as those with neighborhoods, with forbidden
neighborhoods, with time-windows and with profits, can all be framed under this
construct. In sharp contrast to their discrete-optimization counterparts, the
modeling constructs presented in this paper represent a fundamentally new
domain of analysis and computation for TSPs and their variants. Beyond its
apparent mathematical unification of a class of problems in graph theory, the
main advantage of the new approach is that it facilitates the modeling of
certain application-specific problems in their home space of measurable
functions. Consequently, certain elements of economic system theory such as
dynamical models and continuous-time cost/profit functionals can be directly
incorporated in the new optimization problem formulation. Furthermore, subtour
elimination constraints, prevalent in discrete optimization formulations, are
naturally enforced through continuity requirements. The price for the new
modeling framework is nonsmooth functionals. Although a number of theoretical
issues remain open in the proposed mathematical framework, we demonstrate the

Zenoness: whether there exists a zeno-computation from a given marking, i.e.,
an infinite computation which takes only a finite amount of time. We show
decidability of zenoness for TPNs, thus solving an open problem from [Escrig et
al.]. Furthermore, the related question if there exist arbitrarily fast
computations from a given marking is also decidable. On the other hand,
universal zenoness, i.e., the question if all infinite computations from a
given marking are zeno, is undecidable. (ii) Token liveness: whether a token is
alive in a marking, i.e., whether there is a computation from the marking which
eventually consumes the token. We show decidability of the problem by reducing
it to the coverability problem, which is decidable for TPNs. (iii) Boundedness:
whether the size of the reachable markings is bounded. We consider two versions
of the problem; namely semantic boundedness where only live tokens are taken
into consideration in the markings, and syntactic boundedness where also dead

deep features were augmented with age and gender features in the final fully
connected layers. Output thresholds for each class were set using a constrained

clinicians independently interpreted a random set of 100 misclassified ECGs

teams are more active when their teams lose and so are the fans of the bottom
teams in an unexpected win. Second, we study fan behavior over consecutive

in many important cases these have first-order equivalents. Computing such
equivalents is important for both logical and computational reasons. On the
other hand, canonicity of modal formulae is important, too, because it implies
frame-completeness of logics axiomatized with canonical formulae.
  Computing a first-order equivalent of a modal formula amounts to elimination
of second-order quantifiers. Two algorithms have been developed for
second-order quantifier elimination: SCAN, based on constraint resolution, and
DLS, based on a logical equivalence established by Ackermann.
  In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, SQEMA, for computing first-order
equivalents (using a modal version of Ackermann's lemma) and, moreover, for
proving canonicity of modal formulae. Unlike SCAN and DLS, it works directly on
modal formulae, thus avoiding Skolemization and the subsequent problem of
unskolemization. We present the core algorithm and illustrate it with some
examples. We then prove its correctness and the canonicity of all formulae on
which the algorithm succeeds. We show that it succeeds not only on all
Sahlqvist formulae, but also on the larger class of inductive formulae,

reference to an ensemble of reference stars. For optimal performance, these
reference stars should have similar colour and magnitude to the target quasar.
In addition, the greatest quantity and quality of suitable reference stars may
be found by using a telescope pointing which offsets the target object from the
centre of the field of view. By comparing each quasar with the stars which
appear close to it on the sky in the SDSS Catalogue, an optimum pointing can be
calculated, and a figure of merit, referred to as the ""score"" calculated for
that pointing. Highly flexible software has been developed to enable this
process to be automated and implemented in a distributed computing paradigm,
which enables the creation of catalogues of pointings given a set of input

computed using only a demand distribution. Then after observing the demand
instantiations, a recourse route is computed -- but costs here become more
expensive by a factor lambda.
  We present an O(log^2 n log(n lambda))-approximation algorithm for this
stochastic routing problem, under arbitrary distributions. The main idea in
this result is relating StochVRP to a special case of submodular orienteering,
called knapsack rank-function orienteering. We also give a better approximation
ratio for knapsack rank-function orienteering than what follows from prior
work. Finally, we provide a Unique Games Conjecture based omega(1) hardness of
approximation for StochVRP, even on star-like metrics on which our algorithm
achieves a logarithmic approximation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

wanted to examine how well ANEW and other word lists performs for the detection
of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list

to model image distributions. They learn to emulate the training set and that
enables sampling from that domain and using the knowledge learned for useful

during the adversarial training of GAN on the base set X, and we call this
novel model K-GAN. We show that minimizing the added term follows from
cross-entropy minimization between the distributions of GAN and the set Y.
Then, We introduce a cascaded framework for GANs that try to address the task
of imagining a new distribution that combines the base set X and target set Y
by cascading sampling GANs with translation GANs, and we dub the cascade of

fine-grained and stable measure of system equivalence than crisp notions of
bisimilarity. They correlate strongly to quantitative probabilistic logics, and
in fact the distance induced by a probabilistic modal logic taking values in
the real unit interval has been shown to coincide with behavioural distance.
For probabilistic systems, probabilistic modal logic thus plays an analogous
role to that of Hennessy-Milner logic on classical labelled transition systems.
In the quantitative setting, invariance of modal logic under bisimilarity
becomes non-expansivity of formula evaluation w.r.t. behavioural distance. In
the present paper, we provide a characterization of the expressive power of
probabilistic modal logic based on this observation: We prove a probabilistic
analogue of the classical van Benthem theorem, which states that modal logic is
precisely the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic.
Specifically, we show that quantitative probabilistic modal logic lies dense in
the bisimulation-invariant fragment, in the indicated sense of non-expansive
formula evaluation, of quantitative probabilistic first-order logic; more
precisely, bisimulation-invariant first-order formulas are approximable by
modal formulas of bounded rank.

describe, the laws of quantum mechanics impose severe restrictions on how that

have only limited advantages over classical ones.
  First, we show that $\mathsf{BQP/qpoly}\subseteq\mathsf{PP/poly}$, where
$\mathsf{BQP/qpoly}$ is the class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial
time, given a polynomial-size ""quantum advice state"" that depends only on the
input length. This resolves a question of Buhrman, and means that we should not
hope for an unrelativized separation between quantum and classical advice.
Underlying our complexity result is a general new relation between
deterministic and quantum one-way communication complexities, which applies to
partial as well as total functions.
  Second, we construct an oracle relative to which $\mathsf{NP}\not \subset
\mathsf{BQP/qpoly}$. To do so, we use the polynomial method to give the first
correct proof of a direct product theorem for quantum search. This theorem has
other applications; for example, it can be used to fix a result of Klauck about
quantum time-space tradeoffs for sorting.
  Third, we introduce a new trace distance method for proving lower bounds on
quantum one-way communication complexity. Using this method, we obtain optimal
quantum lower bounds for two problems of Ambainis, for which no nontrivial
lower bounds were previously known even for classical randomized protocols.

research). Based on our own combined experiences of working on
cross-disciplinary, problem-driven visualization projects, we present six case
studies that expose the opportunities that design by immersion enables,
including (1) exploring new domain-inspired visualization design spaces, (2)
enriching domain understanding through personal experiences, and (3) building
strong transdisciplinary relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate how the

Moses provides a way to ascribe knowledge to agents in distributed and
multi-agent systems. In this paper we study two special cases of this
framework: full systems and hypercubes. Both model static situations in which
no agent has any information about another agent's state. Full systems and
hypercubes are an appropriate model for the initial configurations of many
systems of interest. We establish a correspondence between full systems and
hypercube systems and certain classes of Kripke frames. We show that these
classes of systems correspond to the same logic. Moreover, this logic is also
the same as that generated by the larger class of weakly directed frames. We
provide a sound and complete axiomatization, S5WDn, of this logic. Finally, we
show that under certain natural assumptions, in a model where knowledge evolves
over time, S5WDn characterizes the properties of knowledge not just at the
initial configuration, but also at all later configurations. In particular,

medium (shared dataspaces vs channel-based), and pattern-matching (binding to a
name vs testing name equality vs intensionality). Here another dimension
coordination is considered that accounts for the number of processes required
for an interaction to occur. Coordination generalises binary languages such as
pi-calculus to joining languages that combine inputs such as the Join Calculus
and general rendezvous calculus. By means of possibility/impossibility of
encodings, this paper shows coordination is unrelated to the other features.
That is, joining languages are more expressive than binary languages, and no
combination of the other features can encode a joining language into a binary

that the surface of P can be reshaped to a homothet of Q by a finite sequence
of ""tailoring"" steps. Each tailoring excises a digon surrounding a single
vertex and sutures the digon closed. One phrasing of this result is that, if Q
can be ""sculpted"" from P by a series of slices with planes, then Q can be
tailored from P. And there is a sense in which tailoring is finer than
sculpting in that P may be tailored to polyhedra that are not achievable by
sculpting P. It is an easy corollary that, if S is the surface of any convex
body, then any convex polyhedron P may be tailored to approximate a homothet of
S as closely as desired. So P can be ""whittled"" to e.g., a sphere S.
  Another main result achieves the same reshaping, but by excising more
complicated shapes we call ""crests,"" still each enclosing one vertex. Reversing
either digon-tailoring or crest-tailoring leads to proofs that any Q inside P
can be enlarged to P by cutting Q and inserting and sealing surface patches.
  One surprising corollary of these results is that, for Q a subset of P, we
can cut-up Q into pieces and paste them non-overlapping onto an isometric
subset of P. This can be viewed as a form of ""unfolding"" Q onto P.

speech enhancement. The proposed approach leverages the complementary strengths
of both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling (filtering based
approach) as compared to recently published, comparatively simpler benchmark
approaches that rely only on deep learning. The proposed audio-visual (AV)
speech enhancement framework operates at two levels. In the first level, a
novel deep learning-based lip-reading regression model is employed. In the
second level, lip-reading approximated clean-audio features are exploited,
using an enhanced, visually-derived Wiener filter (EVWF), for the clean audio
power spectrum estimation. Specifically, a stacked long-short-term memory
(LSTM) based lip-reading regression model is designed for clean audio features
estimation using only temporal visual features considering different number of
prior visual frames. For clean speech spectrum estimation, a new
filterbank-domain EVWF is formulated, which exploits estimated speech features.
The proposed EVWF is compared with conventional Spectral Subtraction and
Log-Minimum Mean-Square Error methods using both ideal AV mapping and LSTM
driven AV mapping. The potential of the proposed speech enhancement framework
is evaluated under different dynamic real-world commercially-motivated
scenarios (e.g. cafe, public transport, pedestrian area) at different SNR
levels (ranging from low to high SNRs) using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora.
For objective testing, perceptual evaluation of speech quality is used to
evaluate the quality of restored speech. For subjective testing, the standard

forms (clause-sets).
  Lean clause-sets do not have non-trivial autarkies, that is, it is not
possible to satisfy some clauses and leave the other clauses untouched. The
deficiency of a clause-set is the difference of the number of clauses and the
number of variables. We prove a precise upper bound on the minimum variable
degree of lean clause-sets in dependency on the deficiency. If a clause-set
does not fulfil this upper bound, then it must have a non-trivial autarky; we
show that the autarky-reduction (elimination of affected clauses) can be done
in polynomial time, while it is open to find the autarky itself in polynomial
time.
  Then we investigate this upper bound for the special case of minimally
unsatisfiable clause-sets. We show that the bound can be improved here,
introducing a general method to improve the underlying recurrence.

  Classification by Deep Learning","Early diagnosis of cancer often allows for a more vast choice of therapy
opportunities. After a cancer diagnosis, staging provides essential information
about the extent of disease in the body and the expected response to a
particular treatment. The leading importance of classifying cancer patients at
the early stage into high or low-risk groups has led many research teams, both
from the biomedical and bioinformatics field, to study the application of Deep
Learning (DL) methods. The ability of DL to detect critical features from
complex datasets is a significant achievement in early diagnosis and cell
cancer progression. In this paper, we focus the attention on osteosarcoma.
Osteosarcoma is one of the primary malignant bone tumors which usually afflicts
people in adolescence. Our contribution to the classification of osteosarcoma
cells is made as follows: a DL approach is applied to discriminate human
Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) from osteosarcoma cells and to classify the
different cell populations under investigation. Glass slides of differ-ent cell
populations were cultured including MSCs, differentiated in healthy bone cells
(osteoblasts) and osteosarcoma cells, both single cell populations or mixed.
Images of such samples of isolated cells (single-type of mixed) are recorded
with traditional optical microscopy. DL is then applied to identify and
classify single cells. Proper data augmentation techniques and cross-fold
validation are used to appreciate the capabilities of a convolutional neural
network to address the cell detection and classification problem. Based on the
results obtained on individual cells, and to the versatility and scalability of
our DL approach, the next step will be its application to discriminate and

exists; for $C=2$ a bespoke computer program had generated sequences of length
$1124$ of discrepancy $2$, but the status of the conjecture remained open even
for such a small bound. We show that by encoding the problem into Boolean
satisfiability and applying the state of the art SAT solvers, one can obtain a
discrepancy $2$ sequence of length $1160$ and a proof of the Erd\H{o}s
discrepancy conjecture for $C=2$, claiming that no discrepancy 2 sequence of
length $1161$, or more, exists. In the similar way, we obtain a precise bound
of $127\,645$ on the maximal lengths of both multiplicative and completely
multiplicative sequences of discrepancy $3$. We also demonstrate that
unrestricted discrepancy 3 sequences can be longer than $130\,000$.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

temporal operators that are indexed by time intervals, allowing one to specify
timing-dependent security policies. The design of the language is driven by the
problem of runtime monitoring of applications in mobile devices. A main case
the study is the privilege escalation attack in the Android operating system,
where an app gains access to certain resource or functionalities that are not
explicitly granted to it by the user, through indirect control flow. To capture
these attacks, we extend MTL with recursive definitions, that are used to
express call chains betwen apps. We then show how the metric operators of MTL,
in combination with recursive definitions, can be used to specify policies to
detect privilege escalation, under various fine grained constraints. We present
a new algorithm, extending that of linear time temporal logic, for monitoring
safety policies written in our specification language. The monitor does not
need to store the entire history of events generated by the apps, something
that is crucial for practical implementations. We modified the Android OS

in a random graph. To find whether an edge $e$ exists, we need to perform an
expensive test, in which case the edge $e$ appears independently with a
\emph{known} probability $p_e$. Given a budget on the total cost of the tests,
our goal is to find a testing strategy that maximizes the expected maximum
matching size.
  The above application is an example of the stochastic probing problem. In
general the optimal stochastic probing strategy is difficult to find because it
is \emph{adaptive}---decides on the next edge to probe based on the outcomes of
the probed edges. An alternate approach is to show the \emph{adaptivity gap} is
small, i.e., the best \emph{non-adaptive} strategy always has a value close to
the best adaptive strategy. This allows us to focus on designing non-adaptive
strategies that are much simpler. Previous works, however, have focused on
Bernoulli random variables that can only capture whether an edge appears or
not. In this work we introduce a multi-value stochastic probing problem, which
can also model situations where the weight of an edge has a probability
distribution over multiple values.
  Our main technical contribution is to obtain (near) optimal bounds for the
(worst-case) adaptivity gaps for multi-value stochastic probing over
prefix-closed constraints. For a monotone submodular function, we show the
adaptivity gap is at most $2$ and provide a matching lower bound. For a
weighted rank function of a $k$-extendible system (a generalization of
intersection of $k$ matroids), we show the adaptivity gap is between $O(k\log

  A sequence of Boolean expressions alpha is an implicant of a set of sequences

  This notion of a generalized implicant takes on special significance when
each of the sequences in the set A describes a disallowed pattern of behavior.
That is because a disallowed sequence of Boolean expressions represents a
logical/temporal dependency, and because the implicants of a set of disallowed
Boolean sequences A are themselves disallowed and represent precisely those
dependencies that follow as a logical consequence from the dependencies
represented by A. The main result of the theory is a necessary and sufficient
condition for a sequence of Boolean expressions to be an implicant of a regular
set of sequences of Boolean expressions. This result is the foundation for two
new proof methods. Sequential resolution is a generalization of Boolean
resolution which allows new logical/temporal dependencies to be inferred from

deterministic edges in the underlying base grid and weak ties are modeled as
random edges connecting remote nodes. The probability of connecting a node $u$
with node $v$ through a weak tie is proportional to $1/|uv|^\alpha$, where
$|uv|$ is the grid distance between $u$ and $v$ and $\alpha\ge 0$ is the
parameter of the model. Complex contagion refers to the propagation mechanism
in a network where each node is activated only after $k \ge 2$ neighbors of the
node are activated.
  In this paper, we propose the concept of routing of complex contagion (or
complex routing), where we can activate one node at one time step with the goal
of activating the targeted node in the end. We consider decentralized routing
scheme where only the weak ties from the activated nodes are revealed. We study
the routing time of complex contagion and compare the result with simple
routing and complex diffusion (the diffusion of complex contagion, where all
nodes that could be activated are activated immediately in the same step with
the goal of activating all nodes in the end).
  We show that for decentralized complex routing, the routing time is lower
bounded by a polynomial in $n$ (the number of nodes in the network) for all
range of $\alpha$ both in expectation and with high probability (in particular,
$\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha+2}})$ for $\alpha \le 2$ and
$\Omega(n^{\frac{\alpha}{2(\alpha+2)}})$ for $\alpha > 2$ in expectation),
while the routing time of simple contagion has polylogarithmic upper bound when

classical {\it one-way multi-head finite automata} (J. Hromkovi\v{c}, Acta
Informatica 19 (1983) 377-384), and it has been shown that this new one-way
QFAs (multi-letter QFAs) can accept with no error some regular languages
$(a+b)^{*}b$ that are unacceptable by the previous one-way QFAs. In this paper,
we study the decidability of the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs, and the main
technical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that any two automata, a
$k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\cal A}_1$ and a $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\cal A}_2$, over the
same input alphabet $\Sigma$ are equivalent if and only if they are
$(n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k)$-equivalent, where $m=|\Sigma|$ is the cardinality of
$\Sigma$, $k=\max(k_{1},k_{2})$, and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$, with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$
being the numbers of states of ${\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\cal A}_{2}$, respectively.
When $k=1$, we obtain the decidability of equivalence of measure-once QFAs in
the literature. It is worth mentioning that our technical method is essentially
different from that for the decidability of the case of single input alphabet
(i.e., $m=1$). (2) However, if we determine the equivalence of multi-letter
QFAs by checking all strings of length not more than $ n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k$,
then the worst time complexity is exponential, i.e.,
$O(n^6m^{n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+2k-1})$. Therefore, we design a polynomial-time
$O(m^{2k-1}n^{8}+km^kn^{6})$ algorithm for determining the equivalence of any
two multi-letter QFAs. Here, the time complexity is concerning the number of
states in the multi-letter QFAs, and $k$ is thought of as a constant.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

specifications of the Object Management Group (OMG) are our initial targets.
Our motivation is that such specifications are dense and intricate to use, and
tend to have complicated structures. Our objective is therefore to create an
approach that allows us to reengineer PDF-based documents, and to illustrate
how to make more usable versions of electronic documents (such as
specifications, technical books, etc) so that end users to have a better
experience with them. The first step was to extract the logical structure of
the document in a meaningful XML format for subsequent processing. Our initial
assumption was that, many key concepts of a document are expressed in this
structure. In the next phase, we created a multilayer hypertext version of the
document to facilitate browsing and navigating. Although we initially focused
on OMG software specifications, we chose a general approach for different
phases of our work including format conversions, logical structure extraction,
text extraction, multilayer hypertext generation, and concept exploration. As a
consequence, we can process other complex documents to achieve our goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

projection-based methods require no candidate hyponym-hypernym pairs. While it
is natural to use both positive and negative training examples in supervised
relation extraction, the impact of negative examples on hypernym prediction was

that, given the labels of two nodes and no other information regarding the
graph, it is possible to determine the distance between the two nodes. The
challenge in such a distance labeling scheme is primarily to minimize the
maximum label lenght and secondarily to minimize the time needed to answer
distance queries (decoding). Previous schemes have offered different trade-offs
between label lengths and query time. This paper presents a simple algorithm
with shorter labels and shorter query time than any previous solution, thereby
improving the state-of-the-art with respect to both label length and query time
in one single algorithm. Our solution addresses several open problems
concerning label length and decoding time and is the first improvement of label
length for more than three decades.
  More specifically, we present a distance labeling scheme with label size (log
3)/2 + o(n) (logarithms are in base 2) and O(1) decoding time. This outperforms
all existing results with respect to both size and decoding time, including
Winkler's (Combinatorica 1983) decade-old result, which uses labels of size
(log 3)n and O(n/log n) decoding time, and Gavoille et al. (SODA'01), which
uses labels of size 11n + o(n) and O(loglog n) decoding time. In addition, our
algorithm is simpler than the previous ones. In the case of integral edge
weights of size at most W, we present almost matching upper and lower bounds
for label sizes. For r-additive approximation schemes, where distances can be
off by an additive constant r, we give both upper and lower bounds. In
particular, we present an upper bound for 1-additive approximation schemes
which, in the unweighted case, has the same size (ignoring second order terms)
as an adjacency scheme: n/2. We also give results for bipartite graphs and for
exact and 1-additive distance oracles.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

planar graph $G^1 = (V^1, E^1)$ and $G^2 = (V^2, E^2)$ sharing a common
subgraph $G = G^1 \cap G^2$ whether they admit planar drawings such that the
common graph is drawn the same in both. Previous results on this problem
require $G$, $G^1$ and $G^2$ to be connected. This paper is a first step
towards solving instances where these graphs are disconnected.
  First, we show that an instance of the general SEFE-problem can be reduced in
linear time to an equivalent instance where $V^1 = V^2$ and $G^1$ and $G^2$ are
connected. This shows that it can be assumed without loss of generality that
both input graphs are connected. Second, we consider instances where $G$ is
disconnected. We show that SEFE can be solved in linear time if $G$ is a family
of disjoint cycles by introducing the CC-tree, which represents all
simultaneous embeddings. We extend these results (including the CC-tree) to the
case where $G$ consists of arbitrary connected components, each with a fixed
embedding.
  Note that previous results require $G$ to be connected and thus do not need
to care about relative positions of connected components. By contrast, we
assume the embedding of each connected component to be fixed and thus focus on
these relative positions. As SEFE requires to deal with both, embeddings of
connected components and their relative positions, this complements previous

  Algorithms for Ruling Sets","We study local symmetry breaking problems in the CONGEST model, focusing on
ruling set problems, which generalize the fundamental Maximal Independent Set
(MIS) problem. A $\beta$-ruling set is an independent set such that every node
in the graph is at most $\beta$ hops from a node in the independent set. Our
work is motivated by the following central question: can we break the
$\Theta(\log n)$ time complexity barrier and the $\Theta(m)$ message complexity
barrier in the CONGEST model for MIS or closely-related symmetry breaking
problems? We present the following results:
  - Time Complexity: We show that we can break the $O(\log n)$ ""barrier"" for 2-
and 3-ruling sets. We compute 3-ruling sets in $O\left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log
n}\right)$ rounds with high probability (whp). More generally we show that
2-ruling sets can be computed in $O\left(\log \Delta \cdot (\log n)^{1/2 +
\varepsilon} + \frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$ rounds for any $\varepsilon >
0$, which is $o(\log n)$ for a wide range of $\Delta$ values (e.g., $\Delta =
2^{(\log n)^{1/2-\varepsilon}}$). These are the first 2- and 3-ruling set
algorithms to improve over the $O(\log n)$-round complexity of Luby's algorithm
in the CONGEST model.
  - Message Complexity: We show an $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound on the message
complexity of computing an MIS (i.e., 1-ruling set) which holds also for
randomized algorithms and present a contrast to this by showing a randomized
algorithm for 2-ruling sets that, whp, uses only $O(n \log^2 n)$ messages and
runs in $O(\Delta \log n)$ rounds. This is the first message-efficient
algorithm known for ruling sets, which has message complexity nearly linear in
$n$ (which is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

they are parametrized by the adopted system of beliefs. We show that for one
reduction relation the outcome of its (possibly transfinite) iterations does
not depend on the order of elimination of the strategies. This result does not
hold for the other two reduction relations. However, under a natural assumption
the iterations of all three reduction relations yield the same outcome. The

SLD-computations are inductively sound and complete with respect to least
Herbrand models of logic programs. Dually, the corecursive approach to
SLD-resolution views infinite SLD-computations as successively approximating
infinite terms contained in programs' greatest complete Herbrand models.
State-of-the-art algorithms implementing corecursion in LP are based on loop
detection. However, such algorithms support inference of logical entailment
only for rational terms, and they do not account for the important property of
productivity in infinite SLD-computations. Loop detection thus lags behind
coinductive methods in interactive theorem proving (ITP) and term-rewriting

makes it possible to define and semi-decide a notion of productivity
appropriate to LP. In this paper, we prove soundness of structural resolution
relative to Herbrand model semantics for productive inductive, coinductive, and
mixed inductive-coinductive logic programs.
  We introduce two algorithms that support coinductive proof search for

with productive structural resolution, thus guaranteeing productivity of

assign a subset of $b$ colors to each vertex of G so that adjacent vertices
receive disjoint color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic
coloring problem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to
the Kneser graph $KG_{a,b}$, and gives relaxations approaching the fractional
chromatic number.
  We study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an
($a$:$b$)-coloring. Our main result is that this problem does not admit an
algorithm with running time $f(b)\cdot 2^{o(\log b)\cdot n}$, for any
computable $f(b)$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. A
$(b+1)^n\cdot \text{poly}(n)$-time algorithm due to Nederlof [2008] shows that
this is tight. A direct corollary of our result is that the graph homomorphism
problem does not admit a $2^{O(n+h)}$ algorithm unless ETH fails, even if the
target graph is required to be a Kneser graph. This refines the understanding

directed graphs. Acting as synchronous distributed algorithms, they use their
input graph as a network in which identical processors communicate for a
possibly infinite number of synchronous rounds. For the local variant of those
automata, where the number of rounds is bounded by a constant, Hella et al.
(2012, 2015) have established a logical characterization in terms of basic
modal logic. In this thesis, we provide similar logical characterizations for
two more expressive classes of distributed automata.
  The first class extends local automata with a global acceptance condition and
the ability to alternate between nondeterministic and parallel computations. We
show that it is equivalent to monadic second-order logic on graphs. By
restricting transitions to be nondeterministic or deterministic, we also obtain
two strictly weaker variants for which the emptiness problem is decidable.
  Our second class transfers the standard notion of asynchronous algorithm to
the setting of nonlocal distributed automata. The resulting machines are shown
to be equivalent to a small fragment of least fixpoint logic, and more
specifically, to a restricted variant of the modal {\mu}-calculus that allows
least fixpoints but forbids greatest fixpoints. Exploiting the connection with
logic, we additionally prove that the expressive power of those asynchronous

  Techniques for Minimum-Latency Problems","We introduce a problem that is a common generalization of the uncapacitated
facility location and minimum latency (ML) problems, where facilities need to
be opened to serve clients and also need to be sequentially activated before
they can provide service. Formally, we are given a set \F of n facilities with
facility-opening costs {f_i}, a set of m clients, and connection costs {c_{ij}}
specifying the cost of assigning a client j to a facility i, a root node r
denoting the depot, and a time metric d on \F\cup{r}. Our goal is to open a
subset F of facilities, find a path P starting at r and spanning F to activate
the open facilities, and connect each client j to a facility \phi(j)\in F, so
as to minimize \sum_{i\in F}f_i +\sum_{clients j}(c_{\phi(j),j}+t_j), where t_j
is the time taken to reach \phi(j) along path P. We call this the minimum
latency uncapacitated facility location (MLUFL) problem.
  Our main result is an O(\log n\max{\log n,\log m})-approximation for MLUFL.
We also show that any improvement in this approximation guarantee, implies an
improvement in the (current-best) approximation factor for group Steiner tree.
We obtain constant approximations for two natural special cases of the problem:
(a) related MLUFL (metric connection costs that are a scalar multiple of the
time metric); (b) metric uniform MLUFL (metric connection costs, unform
time-metric). Our LP-based methods are versatile and easily adapted to yield
approximation guarantees for MLUFL in various more general settings, such as
(i) when the latency-cost of a client is a function of the delay faced by the
facility to which it is connected; and (ii) the k-route version, where k
vehicles are routed in parallel to activate the open facilities. Our LP-based
understanding of MLUFL also offers some LP-based insights into ML, which we

  with Noise Removal and Color Restoration","Images obtained in real-world low-light conditions are not only low in
brightness, but they also suffer from many other types of degradation, such as
color bias, unknown noise, detail loss and halo artifacts. In this paper, we
propose a very fast deep learning framework called Bringing the Lightness
(denoted as BLNet) that consists of two U-Nets with a series of well-designed
loss functions to tackle all of the above degradations. Based on Retinex
Theory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into
reflectance and illumination and remove noise in the reflectance during the
decomposition phase. We propose a Noise and Color Bias Control module (NCBC
Module) that contains a convolutional neural network and two loss functions
(noise loss and color loss). This module is only used to calculate the loss
functions during the training phase, so our method is very fast during the test
phase. This module can smooth the reflectance to achieve the purpose of noise
removal while preserving details and edge information and controlling color
bias. We propose a network that can be trained to learn the mapping between
low-light and normal-light illumination and enhance the brightness of images
taken in low-light illumination. We train and evaluate the performance of our
proposed model over the real-world Low-Light (LOL) dataset), and we also test
our model over several other frequently used datasets (LIME, DICM and MEF
datasets). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach
achieves a promising effect with good rubustness and generalization and
outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and
quantitatively. Our method achieves high speed because we use loss functions
instead of introducing additional denoisers for noise removal and color
correction. The code and model are available at

theory distinguishes itself from existing theories for clustering of ordered

bi-objective optimisation problem to obtain a hierarchical clustering seeking
to satisfy both. In particular, the order relation is weighted in the range
$[0,1]$, and if the similarity and the order relation are not aligned, then
order preservation may have to yield in favor of clustering. Finding an optimal
solution is NP-hard, so we provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm,

  Verification","The automatic verification of document authorships is important in various
settings. Researchers are for example judged and compared by the amount and
impact of their publications and public figures are confronted by their posts
on social media platforms. Therefore, it is important that authorship
information in frequently used web services and platforms is correct. The
question whether a given document is written by a given author is commonly

short and written in a rather uniform style. This makes most approaches
unpractical for online databases and knowledge graphs in the scholarly domain.
Here, authorships of scientific publications have to be verified, often with
just abstracts and titles available. To this point, we present our novel
approach LG4AV which combines language models and graph neural networks for
authorship verification. By directly feeding the available texts in a
pre-trained transformer architecture, our model does not need any hand-crafted
stylometric features that are not meaningful in scenarios where the writing
style is, at least to some extent, standardized. By the incorporation of a
graph neural network structure, our model can benefit from relations between
authors that are meaningful with respect to the verification process. For
example, scientific authors are more likely to write about topics that are
addressed by their co-authors and twitter users tend to post about the same

summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually
done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the
efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for
automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the
explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used
confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these
models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex
correlation among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve
the performance. We propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN),
which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention
weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation
and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise
attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings

initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods. HLAN
achieved the best Micro-level AUC and $F_1$ on the top-50 code prediction and

extension with a real induction axiom makes it complete for all real arithmetic
invariants. This yields a parsimonious axiomatization, which serves as the

a state partition which is a bisimulation on some Kripke structure is well
known. It is also well known in model checking that bisimulation is equivalent

Drawing on these observations, we analyze the basic steps of the PT algorithm
from an abstract interpretation perspective, which allows us to reason on
strong preservation in the context of generic inductively defined (temporal)
languages and of possibly non-partitioning abstract models specified by
abstract interpretation. This leads us to design a generalized Paige-Tarjan
algorithm, called GPT, for computing the minimal refinement of an abstract
interpretation-based model that strongly preserves some given language. It
turns out that PT is a straight instance of GPT on the domain of state
partitions for the case of strong preservation of Hennessy-Milner logic. We
provide a number of examples showing that GPT is of general use. We first show
how a well-known efficient algorithm for computing stuttering equivalence can
be viewed as a simple instance of GPT. We then instantiate GPT in order to
design a new efficient algorithm for computing simulation equivalence that is
competitive with the best available algorithms. Finally, we show how GPT allows

the frequency domain and masking techniques. We also make use of the conjecture
that a facial emotions are convoluted with the normal facial features and the
other emotional features; however, they carry linearly separable spatial

authentication makes identity theft by third parties more difficult, it
requires the server to learn and store the user's usage profile. Recently, the
first privacy-preserving implicit authentication system was presented, in which
the server does not learn the user's profile. It uses an ad hoc two-party
computation protocol to compare the user's fresh sampled features against an
encrypted stored user's profile. The protocol requires storing the usage
profile and comparing against it using two different cryptosystems, one of them
order-preserving; furthermore, features must be numerical. We present here a
simpler protocol based on set intersection that has the advantages of: i)
requiring only one cryptosystem; ii) not leaking the relative order of fresh

computer vision, system identification, etc. The challenge is to design
provable algorithms tolerant to a large amount of noises, with small sample
complexity. In this work, we give algorithms achieving strong guarantee under
two realistic noise models. In bounded deterministic noise, an adversary can
add any bounded yet unstructured noise to each column. For this problem, we
present an algorithm that returns a matrix of a small error, with sample
complexity almost as small as the best prior results in the noiseless case. For
sparse random noise, where the corrupted columns are sparse and drawn randomly,
we give an algorithm that exactly recovers an $\mu_0$-incoherent matrix by
probability at least $1-\delta$ with sample complexity as small as
$O\left(\mu_0rn\log (r/\delta)\right)$. This result advances the
state-of-the-art work and matches the lower bound in a worst case. We also
study the scenario where the hidden matrix lies on a mixture of subspaces and
show that the sample complexity can be even smaller. Our proposed algorithms

those with limited voluntary motion control. Automatic techniques for the
detection of tongue gestures represent a promising pathway. Previous studies
have shown the robustness of tongue detection algorithms on adult participants,
but further research is needed to use these methods with children. In this
study, a network architecture for tongue-out gesture recognition was
implemented and evaluated on videos recorded in a naturalistic setting when
children were playing a video-game. A cascade object detector algorithm was
used to detect the participants' faces, and an automated classification scheme
for tongue gesture detection was developed using a convolutional neural network
(CNN). In evaluation experiments conducted, the network was trained using
adults and children's images. The network classification accuracy was evaluated
using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Preliminary classification
results obtained from the analysis of videos of five typically developing
children showed an accuracy of up to 99% in predicting tongue-out gestures.

possible to ensure that evidence that they happened at some point in the past
remains for later detection. Evidence-based dynamic analysis allows execution
to proceed at nearly full speed until the end of an epoch (e.g., a heavyweight
system call). It then examines program state to check for evidence that an
error occurred at some time during that epoch. If so, it rolls back execution
and re-executes the code with instrumentation activated to pinpoint the error.

and efficiency by building dynamic analyses that find buffer overflows, memory
use-after-free errors, and memory leaks. Our evaluation shows that DoubleTake
is efficient, imposing just 4% overhead on average, making it the fastest such

Unlike standard approaches, kLog does not represent a probability distribution

expressive logical and relational representations. kLog allows users to specify
learning problems declaratively. It builds on simple but powerful concepts:
learning from interpretations, entity/relationship data modeling, logic
programming, and deductive databases. Access by the kernel to the rich
representation is mediated by a technique we call graphicalization: the
relational representation is first transformed into a graph --- in particular,
a grounded entity/relationship diagram. Subsequently, a choice of graph kernel
defines the feature space. kLog supports mixed numerical and symbolic data, as
well as background knowledge in the form of Prolog or Datalog programs as in
inductive logic programming systems. The kLog framework can be applied to
tackle the same range of tasks that has made statistical relational learning so
popular, including classification, regression, multitask learning, and
collective classification. We also report about empirical comparisons, showing
that kLog can be either more accurate, or much faster at the same level of

differences match the given edge data. Since an exact match will usually be
impossible, one settles for matching in a least squares sense. This formulation

alternative that best represents the preferences of the group. Agents may
manipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does
not reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people
often do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can
be computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their
expected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote
truthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being
truthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we
examine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner
approval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at
heuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and
makes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a
behavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations
and prioritize high utility candidates in others. We examine when these

statistics. The problem is to maximize the likelihood function with respect to
given data on a statistical model. An algebraic approach to this problem is to
solve a very structured parameterized polynomial system called likelihood
equations. For general choices of data, the number of complex solutions to the
likelihood equations is finite and called the ML-degree of the model. The only
solutions to the likelihood equations that are statistically meaningful are the
real/positive solutions. However, the number of real/positive solutions is not
characterized by the ML-degree. We use discriminants to classify data according
to the number of real/positive solutions of the likelihood equations. We call
these discriminants data-discriminants (DD). We develop a probabilistic
algorithm for computing DDs. Experimental results show that, for the benchmarks

  Discovery from Transcriptome Profiles","The discovery of disease biomarkers from gene expression data has been
greatly advanced by feature selection (FS) methods, especially using ensemble
FS (EFS) strategies with perturbation at the data level (i.e., homogeneous,
Hom-EFS) or method level (i.e., heterogeneous, Het-EFS). Here we proposed a
Hybrid EFS (Hyb-EFS) design that explores both types of perturbation to improve
the stability and the predictive power of candidate biomarkers. With this,
Hyb-EFS aims to disrupt associations of good performance with a single dataset,
single algorithm, or a specific combination of both, which is particularly
interesting for better reproducibility of genomic biomarkers. We investigated
the adequacy of our approach for microarray data related to four types of
cancer, carrying out an extensive comparison with other ensemble and single FS
approaches. Five FS methods were used in our experiments: Wx, Symmetrical
Uncertainty (SU), Gain Ratio (GR), Characteristic Direction (GeoDE), and
ReliefF. We observed that the Hyb-EFS and Het-EFS approaches attenuated the
large performance variation observed for most single FS and Hom-EFS across
distinct datasets. Also, the Hyb-EFS improved upon the stability of the Het-EFS
within our domain. Comparing the Hyb-EFS and Het-EFS composed of the
top-performing selectors (Wx, GR, and SU), our hybrid approach surpassed the
equivalent heterogeneous design and the best Hom-EFS (Hom-Wx). Interestingly,
the rankings produced by our Hyb-EFS reached greater biological plausibility,
with a notably high enrichment for cancer-related genes and pathways. Thus, our
experiments suggest the potential of the proposed Hybrid EFS design in
discovering candidate biomarkers from microarray data. Finally, we provide an

distribution, given access to independent samples from it, are examined under
general $\ell_p$ metrics. The intuitions and results often contrast with the
classic $\ell_1$ case. For $p > 1$, we can learn and test with a number of
samples that is independent of the support size of the distribution: With an
$\ell_p$ tolerance $\epsilon$, $O(\max\{ \sqrt{1/\epsilon^q}, 1/\epsilon^2 \})$
samples suffice for testing uniformity and $O(\max\{ 1/\epsilon^q,
1/\epsilon^2\})$ samples suffice for learning, where $q=p/(p-1)$ is the
conjugate of $p$. As this parallels the intuition that $O(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n)$
samples suffice for the $\ell_1$ case, it seems that $1/\epsilon^q$ acts as an
upper bound on the ""apparent"" support size.
  For some $\ell_p$ metrics, uniformity testing becomes easier over larger
supports: a 6-sided die requires fewer trials to test for fairness than a
2-sided coin, and a card-shuffler requires fewer trials than the die. In fact,
this inverse dependence on support size holds if and only if $p > \frac{4}{3}$.
The uniformity testing algorithm simply thresholds the number of ""collisions""
or ""coincidences"" and has an optimal sample complexity up to constant factors
for all $1 \leq p \leq 2$. Another algorithm gives order-optimal sample
complexity for $\ell_{\infty}$ uniformity testing. Meanwhile, the most natural
learning algorithm is shown to have order-optimal sample complexity for all
$\ell_p$ metrics.

can be obtained in difficult pattern recognition problems by combining or
integrating the outputs of multiple classifiers. This chapter provides an
analytical framework to quantify the improvements in classification results due
to combining. The results apply to both linear combiners and order statistics
combiners. We first show that to a first order approximation, the error rate
obtained over and above the Bayes error rate, is directly proportional to the
variance of the actual decision boundaries around the Bayes optimum boundary.
Combining classifiers in output space reduces this variance, and hence reduces
the ""added"" error. If N unbiased classifiers are combined by simple averaging,
the added error rate can be reduced by a factor of N if the individual errors
in approximating the decision boundaries are uncorrelated. Expressions are then
derived for linear combiners which are biased or correlated, and the effect of
output correlations on ensemble performance is quantified. For order statistics
based non-linear combiners, we derive expressions that indicate how much the
median, the maximum and in general the ith order statistic can improve
classifier performance. The analysis presented here facilitates the
understanding of the relationships among error rates, classifier boundary

  Point Detection Techniques","In the raise of many global organizations deploying their data centers and
content services in India, the prefix reachability performance study from
global destinations garners our attention. The events such as failures and
attacks occurring in the Internet topology have impact on Autonomous System
(AS) paths announced in the control plane and reachability of prefixes from
spatially distributed ASes. As a consequence the customer reachability to the
services in terms of increased latency and outages for a short or long time are
experienced. The challenge in control plane event detection is when the data
plane traffic is able to reach the intended destinations correctly. However
detection of such events are crucial for the operations of content and data
center industries. By monitoring the spatially distributed routing table
features like AS path length distributions, spatial prefix reachability
distribution and covering to overlap route ratio, we can detect the control
plane events. In our work, we study prefix AS paths from the publicly available
route-view data and analyze the global reachability as well as reachability to
Indian AS topology. To capture the spatial events in a single temporal pattern,
we propose a counting based measure using prefixes announced by x % of spatial
peers. Employing statistical characteristics change point detection and
temporal aberration algorithm on the time series of the proposed measure, we
identify the occurrence of long and stochastic control plane events. The impact

single criterion, such as Euclidean distance. However, in many cases there may
not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous
patterns. In such a case, multiple criteria can be defined, and one can test
for anomalies by scalarizing the multiple criteria using a linear combination
of them. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance,
the algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of
weights in the linear combination. In this paper, we introduce a novel
non-parametric multi-criteria anomaly detection method using Pareto depth

  Open Educational Resources","The recent advances in computer-assisted learning systems and the
availability of open educational resources today promise a pathway to providing
cost-efficient, high-quality education to large masses of learners. One of the
most ambitious use cases of computer-assisted learning is to build a lifelong
learning recommendation system. Unlike short-term courses, lifelong learning
presents unique challenges, requiring sophisticated recommendation models that
account for a wide range of factors such as background knowledge of learners or
novelty of the material while effectively maintaining knowledge states of
masses of learners for significantly longer periods of time (ideally, a
lifetime). This work presents the foundations towards building a dynamic,
scalable and transparent recommendation system for education, modelling
learner's knowledge from implicit data in the form of engagement with open
educational resources. We i) use a text ontology based on Wikipedia to
automatically extract knowledge components of educational resources and, ii)
propose a set of online Bayesian strategies inspired by the well-known areas of
item response theory and knowledge tracing. Our proposal, TrueLearn, focuses on
recommendations for which the learner has enough background knowledge (so they
are able to understand and learn from the material), and the material has
enough novelty that would help the learner improve their knowledge about the

multi-label classification tasks. In the RAndom k-labELsets (RAKEL) algorithm,
each member of the ensemble is associated with a small randomly-selected subset
of k labels. Then, a single label classifier is trained according to each
combination of elements in the subset. In this paper we adopt a similar
approach, however, instead of randomly choosing subsets, we select the minimum
required subsets of k labels that cover all labels and meet additional
constraints such as coverage of inter-label correlations. Construction of the
cover is achieved by formulating the subset selection as a minimum set covering
problem (SCP) and solving it by using approximation algorithms. Every cover
needs only to be prepared once by offline algorithms. Once prepared, a cover
may be applied to the classification of any given multi-label dataset whose
properties conform with those of the cover. The contribution of this paper is
two-fold. First, we introduce SCP as a general framework for constructing label
covers while allowing the user to incorporate cover construction constraints.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by proposing two
construction constraints whose enforcement produces covers that improve the
prediction performance of random selection. Second, we provide theoretical
bounds that quantify the probabilities of random selection to produce covers
that meet the proposed construction criteria. The experimental results indicate

each node of $G$ is represented by a horizontal line segment such that the line
segments representing any two adjacent nodes of $G$ are vertically visible to
each other. In the present paper we give the best known compact visibility
representation of $G$. Given a canonical ordering of the triangulated $G$, our
algorithm draws the graph incrementally in a greedy manner. We show that one of
three canonical orderings obtained from Schnyder's realizer for the
triangulated $G$ yields a visibility representation of $G$ no wider than
$\frac{22n-40}{15}$. Our easy-to-implement O(n)-time algorithm bypasses the
complicated subroutines for four-connected components and four-block trees
required by the best previously known algorithm of Kant. Our result provides a
negative answer to Kant's open question about whether $\frac{3n-6}{2}$ is a
worst-case lower bound on the required width. Also, if $G$ has no degree-three
(respectively, degree-five) internal node, then our visibility representation
for $G$ is no wider than $\frac{4n-9}{3}$ (respectively, $\frac{4n-7}{3}$).
Moreover, if $G$ is four-connected, then our visibility representation for $G$
is no wider than $n-1$, matching the best known result of Kant and He. As a

system behavior. The size of parallel computing systems and the number of their
components steadily increase. The volume of generated logs by the system is in
proportion to this increase. Hence, long-term collection and storage of system
logs is challenging. The analysis of system logs requires advanced text
processing techniques. For very large volumes of logs, the analysis is highly
time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. For many parallel
computing centers, outsourcing the analysis of system logs to third parties is
the only affordable option. The existence of sensitive data within system log
entries obstructs, however, the transmission of system logs to third parties.
Moreover, the analytical tools for processing system logs and the solutions
provided by such tools are highly system specific. Achieving a more general
solution is only possible through the access and analysis system of logs of
multiple computing systems. The privacy concerns impede, however, the sharing
of system logs across institutions as well as in the public domain. This work
proposes a new method for the anonymization of the information within system
logs that employs de-identification and encoding to provide sharable system
logs, with the highest possible data quality and of reduced size. The results
presented in this work indicate that apart from eliminating the sensitive data

has attempted to articulate a set of ""literacies"" to describe the intellectual
tools that children can use to understand, interrogate, and critique the
algorithmic systems that shape their lives. Unfortunately, because many
algorithms are invisible, only a small number of children develop the
literacies required to critique these systems. How might designers support the
development of critical algorithmic literacies? Based on our experience
designing two data programming systems, we present four design principles that
we argue can help children develop literacies that allow them to understand not
only how algorithms work, but also to critique and question them.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

  virtualized Networks","Maintaining a resilient computer network is a delicate task with conflicting
priorities. Flows should be served while controlling risk due to attackers.
Upon publication of a vulnerability, administrators scramble to manually
mitigate risk before a patch is available. Tools exist to check network
reachability (Khurshid et al., NSDI 2013) and risk using (probabilistic) attack
graphs (Sheyner et al., IEEE S\&P 2002). These tools are not designed to
fashion configurations that simultaneously satisfy multiple properties.
  We introduce FASHION: a linear optimizer that \emph{fashions} network
configurations to balance functionality and security requirements. FASHION
formalizes functionality as a multi-commodity flow problem with
side-constraints. FASHION formulates security as the average of 1) the risk of
the connected component in the attack graph and 2) the highest probability path
in the attack graph. These measures approximate the risk in a probabilistic
attack graph (Wang et al., Network Security Metrics 2017). FASHION outputs a
set of software-defined networking rules consumable by a Frenetic controller
(Foster et al., ICFP 2011). The approximation linearly combines two measures.
One measure is the impact of the set of nodes the attacker can reach in the
attack graph (ignoring probability). The second is the maximum probability path
in the attack graph.
  FASHION is evaluated on data center networks with up to 649 devices, usually
outputting a solution in under 30 minutes. FASHION allows an enterprise to
automatically reconfigure their network upon a change in functionality (shift
in user demand) or security (publication or patching of a vulnerability).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

good assignment of worker threads to servers and also effectively allocating
each server's resources to its assigned threads. The assignment and allocation
components of this problem have been studied extensively but largely separately
in the literature. In this paper, we introduce the assign and allocate (AA)
problem, which seeks to simultaneously find an assignment and allocation that
maximizes the total utility of the threads. Assigning and allocating the
threads together can result in substantially better overall utility than
performing the steps separately, as is traditionally done. We model each thread
by a utility function giving its performance as a function of its assigned
resources. We first prove that the AA problem is NP-hard. We then present a $2

functions, which runs in $O(mn^2 + n (\log mC)^2)$ time for $n$ threads and $m$
servers with $C$ amount of resources each. We also give a faster algorithm with

extend the problem to two more general settings. First, we consider threads
with nonconcave utility functions, and give a 1/2 factor approximation

method involves reconstructing a very small number of head poses of the actor
in 3D, where the head poses span different configurations of force directions
due to gravity. Our algorithm can then automatically recover both the
gravity-free rest shape of the face as well as the spatially-varying physical
material stiffness such that a forward simulation will match the captured
targets as closely as possible. As a result, our system can produce
actor-specific, physical parameters that can be immediately used in recent

increasingly expensive as the continuum limit is approached since the cost per
independent sample grows with a high power of the inverse lattice spacing.
Simulations on fine lattices suffer from critical slowdown, the rapid growth of
autocorrelations in the Markov chain. This causes a strong increase in the
number of lattice configurations that have to be generated to obtain
statistically significant results. This paper discusses hierarchical sampling
methods to tame the growth in autocorrelations. Combined with multilevel
variance reduction, this significantly reduces the computational cost of
simulations for given tolerances $\epsilon_{\text{disc}}$ on the discretisation
error and $\epsilon_{\text{stat}}$ on the statistical error. For observables
with lattice errors of order $\alpha$ and integrated autocorrelation times that
grow like $\tau_{\mathrm{int}}\propto a^{-z}$, multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)
reduces the cost from
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-(1+z)/\alpha})$
to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\vert\log \epsilon_{\text{disc}}
\vert^2+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$ or
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$.
Higher gains are expected for simulations of quantum field theories in $D$
dimensions. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on two model
systems, including a topological oscillator that is badly affected by critical
slowdown from topological charge freezing. On fine lattices, the new methods
are orders of magnitude faster than standard Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. For
high resolutions, MLMC can be used to accelerate even the cluster algorithm for
the topological oscillator. Performance is further improved through

problem in queueing theory. The Gittins index policy is known to be the optimal
preemptive nonanticipating policy (both for the open version of the problem
with Poisson arrivals and the closed version without arrivals) minimizing the
expected holding costs. While the Gittins index is thoroughly characterized for
ordinary jobs whose state is described by the attained service, it is not at
all the case with jobs that have more complex structure. Recently, a class of
such jobs, the multistage jobs, were introduced, and it was shown that the
computation of Gittins index of a multistage job reduces into separable
computations for the individual stages. The characterization is, however,
indirect in the sense that it relies on the recursion for an auxiliary function
(so called SJP function) and not for the Gittins index itself. In this paper,
we answer the natural question: Is it possible to compute the Gittins index for
a multistage job more directly by recursively combining the Gittins indexes of
its individual stages? According to our results, it seems to be possible, at
least, for sequential multistage jobs that have a fixed (deterministic)
sequence of stages. We prove this for sequential two-stage jobs that have
monotonous hazard rates in both stages, but our numerical experiments give an
indication that the result could possibly be generalized to any sequential
multistage jobs. Our approach, in this paper, is based on the Whittle index

  spatial, meteorological and calendrical context","Bike sharing demand is increasing in large cities worldwide. The proper
functioning of bike-sharing systems is, nevertheless, dependent on a balanced
geographical distribution of bicycles throughout a day. In this context,
understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of check-ins and check-outs is
key for station balancing and bike relocation initiatives. Still, recent
contributions from deep learning and distance-based predictors show limited
success on forecasting bike sharing demand. This consistent observation is
hypothesized to be driven by: i) the strong dependence between demand and the
meteorological and situational context of stations; and ii) the absence of
spatial awareness as most predictors are unable to model the effects of
high-low station load on nearby stations.
  This work proposes a comprehensive set of new principles to incorporate both
historical and prospective sources of spatial, meteorological, situational and
calendrical context in predictive models of station demand. To this end, a new
recurrent neural network layering composed by serial long-short term memory

multivariate time series masks produced from historical context data at the

properly established model of motion, capable of describing its rich context.
However, commonly used motion representations often fail to accurately encode
the full articulation of motion, or present artifacts. In this work, we address
the fundamental problem of finding a robust pose representation for motion
modeling, suitable for deep character animation, one that can better constrain
poses and faithfully capture nuances correlated with skeletal characteristics.
Our representation is based on dual quaternions, the mathematical abstractions
with well-defined operations, which simultaneously encode rotational and
positional orientation, enabling a hierarchy-aware encoding, centered around
the root. We demonstrate that our representation overcomes common motion
artifacts, and assess its performance compared to other popular
representations. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of various
losses that can be incorporated during learning. Leveraging the fact that our
representation implicitly encodes skeletal motion attributes, we train a
network on a dataset comprising of skeletons with different proportions,
without the need to retarget them first to a universal skeleton, which causes
subtle motion elements to be missed. We show that smooth and natural poses can

  Combination","Objective: Breast cancer screening is of great significance in contemporary
women's health prevention. The existing machines embedded in the AI system do
not reach the accuracy that clinicians hope. How to make intelligent systems
more reliable is a common problem. Methods: 1) Ultrasound image
super-resolution: the SRGAN super-resolution network reduces the unclearness of
ultrasound images caused by the device itself and improves the accuracy and
generalization of the detection model. 2) In response to the needs of medical
images, we have improved the YOLOv4 and the CenterNet models. 3) Multi-AI
model: based on the respective advantages of different AI models, we employ two
AI models to determine clinical resuls cross validation. And we accept the same
results and refuses others. Results: 1) With the help of the super-resolution
model, the YOLOv4 model and the CenterNet model both increased the mAP score by
9.6% and 13.8%. 2) Two methods for transforming the target model into a
classification model are proposed. And the unified output is in a specified
format to facilitate the call of the molti-AI model. 3) In the classification
evaluation experiment, concatenated by the YOLOv4 model (sensitivity 57.73%,
specificity 90.08%) and the CenterNet model (sensitivity 62.64%, specificity
92.54%), the multi-AI model will refuse to make judgments on 23.55% of the

makes the AI model more reliable in medical image diagnosis. Significance: 1)

structure is useful for analyzing termination: this information guarantees that
the depth of the data structure to which x points is greater than the depth of
the structure pointed to by x.fld, and allows bounding the number of iterations
of a loop which traverses the data structure on fld. In general, proving
termination needs acyclicity, unless program-specific or non-automated
reasoning is performed. However, recent work could prove that certain loops
terminate even without inferring acyclicity, because they traverse data
structures ""acyclically"". Consider a double-linked list: if it is possible to
demonstrate that every cycle involves both the ""next"" and the ""prev"" field,
then a traversal on ""next"" terminates since no cycle will be traversed
completely. This paper develops a static analysis inferring field-sensitive
reachability and cyclicity information, which is more general than existing
approaches. Propositional formulae are computed, which describe which fields
may or may not be traversed by paths in the heap. Consider a tree with edges
""left"" and ""right"" to the left and right sub-trees, and ""parent"" to the parent
node: termination of a loop traversing leaf-up cannot be guaranteed by

requiring either a network of time-invarient perceptrons or a complex

possible, mainly because of two reasons: (i) the model is still under
development and (ii) the correctness of implementation of some modules is not
established. In such circumstances, is it still possible to get correct answers
for some model checking queries?
  This paper is a step towards answering this question. We formulate this
problem for the Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) modeling formalism and the
Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) query language. We then propose a
simple solution by modifying DTMC and PCTL to accommodate three valued logic.
The technique builds on existing model checking algorithms and tools, obviating
the need for new ones to account for three valued logic.
  One of the most useful and popular techniques for modeling complex systems is
through discrete event simulation. Discrete event simulators are essentially
code in some programming language. We show an application of our approach on a
piece of code that contains a module of unknown correctness.

that computing fotw is fixed-parameter tractable with parameter fotw. Moreover,
we show that on classes of formulae of bounded fotw, model checking is fixed
parameter tractable, with parameter the length of the formula. This is done by
translating a formula \phi\ with fotw(\phi)<k into a formula of the k-variable
fragment L^k of first order logic. For fixed k, the question whether a given
first order formula is equivalent to an L^k formula is undecidable. In
contrast, the classes of first order formulae with bounded fotw are fragments
of first order logic for which the equivalence is decidable.
  Our notion of tree-width generalises tree-width of conjunctive queries to
arbitrary formulae of first order logic by taking into account the quantifier
interaction in a formula. Moreover, it is more powerful than the notion of
elimination-width of quantified constraint formulae, defined by Chen and Dalmau
(CSL 2005): for quantified constraint formulae, both bounded elimination-width
and bounded fotw allow for model checking in polynomial time. We prove that
fotw of a quantified constraint formula \phi\ is bounded by the
elimination-width of \phi, and we exhibit a class of quantified constraint
formulae with bounded fotw, that has unbounded elimination-width. A similar
comparison holds for strict tree-width of non-recursive stratified datalog as

their variables are instantiated or bound. The former functionality is at best
difficult to simulate using more primitive coroutining statements such as

runtime library by a new dual-pivot Quicksort variant due to Vladimir
Yaroslavskiy. The decision was based on the strikingly good performance of
Yaroslavskiy's implementation in running time experiments. At that time, no
precise investigations of the algorithm were available to explain its superior
performance - on the contrary: Previous theoretical studies of other dual-pivot
Quicksort variants even discouraged the use of two pivots. Only in 2012, two of
the authors gave an average case analysis of a simplified version of
Yaroslavskiy's algorithm, proving that savings in the number of comparisons are
possible. However, Yaroslavskiy's algorithm needs more swaps, which renders the
analysis inconclusive.
  To force the issue, we herein extend our analysis to the fully detailed style
of Knuth: We determine the exact number of executed Java Bytecode instructions.
Surprisingly, Yaroslavskiy's algorithm needs sightly more Bytecode instructions
than a simple implementation of classic Quicksort - contradicting observed
running times. Like in Oracle's library implementation we incorporate the use
of Insertionsort on small subproblems and show that it indeed speeds up
Yaroslavskiy's Quicksort in terms of Bytecodes; but even with optimal
Insertionsort thresholds the new Quicksort variant needs slightly more Bytecode
instructions on average.
  Finally, we show that the (suitably normalized) costs of Yaroslavskiy's

a certain size that we can later use to estimate the total weight of arbitrary
subsets. For this purpose, we propose priority sampling which tested on
Internet data performed better than previous methods by orders of magnitude.
  Priority sampling is simple to define and implement: we consider a steam of
items i=0,...,n-1 with weights w_i. For each item i, we generate a random
number r_i in (0,1) and create a priority q_i=w_i/r_i. The sample S consists of
the k highest priority items. Let t be the (k+1)th highest priority. Each
sampled item i in S gets a weight estimate W_i=max{w_i,t}, while non-sampled
items get weight estimate W_i=0.
  Magically, it turns out that the weight estimates are unbiased, that is,
E[W_i]=w_i, and by linearity of expectation, we get unbiased estimators over
any subset sum simply by adding the sampled weight estimates from the subset.
Also, we can estimate the variance of the estimates, and surpricingly, there is
no co-variance between different weight estimates W_i and W_j.
  We conjecture an extremely strong near-optimality; namely that for any weight
sequence, there exists no specialized scheme for sampling k items with unbiased
estimators that gets smaller total variance than priority sampling with k+1
items. Very recently Mario Szegedy has settled this conjecture.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

currently impossible for an astronomer to pose a query like ""give me all

allow iterative refinements until converging to a final result. Enabling the
user to interact with the intermediate results allows an early detection of
erroneous or suboptimal choices, the guided definition of modifications to the

any obstacle in designing truthful mechanisms, even for multi-parameter
domains, and even when we can only call the allocation rule once. We present a
general reduction that takes any allocation rule which satisfies ""cyclic
monotonicity"" (a known necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness) and
converts it to a truthful mechanism using a single call to the allocation rule,
with arbitrarily small loss to the expected social welfare.
  A prominent example for a multi-parameter setting in which an allocation rule
can only be called once arises in sponsored search auctions. These are
multi-parameter domains when each advertiser has multiple possible ads he may
display, each with a different value per click. Moreover, the mechanism
typically does not have complete knowledge of the click-realization or the
click-through rates (CTRs); it can only call the allocation rule a single time
and observe the click information for ads that were presented. % are not known.
On the negative side, we show that an allocation that is truthful for any
realization essentially cannot depend on the bids, and hence cannot do better
than random selection for one agent. We then consider a relaxed requirement of
truthfulness, only in expectation over the CTRs. Even for that relaxed version,
making any progress is challenging as standard techniques for construction of
truthful mechanisms (as using VCG or an MIDR allocation rule) cannot be used in
this setting. We design an allocation rule with non-trivial performance and
directly prove it is cyclic-monotone, and thus it can be used to create a

for determining the inexactness which is allowed, at each iteration, when
computing objective function values and derivatives. The complexity analysis
covers arbitrary optimality order and arbitrary degree of available approximate

evaluation complexity to the inexact case: if a $q$th order minimizer is sought
using approximations to the first $p$ derivatives, it is proved that a suitable

automatically solving decision-making problems in complex uncertain

interaction in an environment with stochastic behavior, where agents take
actions to maximize some cumulative short-term and long-term rewards. Some of
the most impressive results have been shown in Game Theory where agents
exhibited superhuman performance in games like Go or Starcraft 2, which led to
its gradual adoption in many other domains, including Cloud Computing.
Therefore, RL appears as a promising approach for Autoscaling in Cloud since it
is possible to learn transparent (with no human intervention), dynamic (no
static plans), and adaptable (constantly updated) resource management policies
to execute applications. These are three important distinctive aspects to
consider in comparison with other widely used autoscaling policies that are
defined in an ad-hoc way or statically computed as in solutions based on
meta-heuristics. Autoscaling exploits the Cloud elasticity to optimize the
execution of applications according to given optimization criteria, which
demands to decide when and how to scale-up/down computational resources, and
how to assign them to the upcoming processing workload. Such actions have to be
taken considering that the Cloud is a dynamic and uncertain environment.
Motivated by this, many works apply RL to the autoscaling problem in the Cloud.

cyber-physical systems. Hybrid system models describe the required interplay of
computation and physical dynamics, which is crucial to guarantee what
computations lead to safe physical behavior (e.g., cars should not collide).
Control computations that affect physical dynamics must act in advance to avoid
possibly unsafe future circumstances. Formal verification then ensures that the
controllers correctly identify and provably avoid unsafe future situations
under a certain model of physics. But any model of physics necessarily deviates
from reality and, moreover, any observation with real sensors and manipulation
with real actuators is subject to uncertainty. This makes runtime validation a
crucial step to monitor whether the model assumptions hold for the real system
implementation.
  The key question is what property needs to be runtime-monitored and what a
satisfied runtime monitor entails about the safety of the system: the
observations of a runtime monitor only relate back to the safety of the system
if they are themselves accompanied by a proof of correctness! For an unbroken
chain of correctness guarantees, we, thus, synthesize runtime monitors in a
provably correct way from provably safe hybrid system models. This paper
addresses the inevitable challenge of making the synthesized monitoring

enabling to incorporate the effective micromechanical response in macroscale

the prediction of stress outputs at particular strain space locations by
training local regression models based on Gaussian processes, using only a

This is an enormous opportunity for real-estate operators to innovate and
address the demand in this growing market. However, investments in this area
are fraught with risk. Seniors often have more health issues, and Covid-19 has
exposed just how vulnerable they are -- especially those living in close
proximity. Conventionally, most services for seniors are ""high-touch"",
requiring close physical contact with trained caregivers. Not only are trained
caregivers short in supply, but the pandemic has made it evident that
conventional high-touch approaches to senior care are high-cost and greater
risk. There are not enough caregivers to meet the needs of this emerging
demographic, and even fewer who want to undertake the additional training and
risk of working in a senior facility, especially given the current pandemic. In
this article, we rethink the design of senior living facilities to mitigate the
risks and costs using automation. With AI-enabled pervasive automation, we
claim there is an opportunity, if not an urgency, to go from high-touch to
almost ""no touch"" while dramatically reducing risk and cost. Although our

abstraction for sensor networks is challenging due to communication errors and

reliability for a \emph{local read-write} abstraction. Local read-write is
inspired by the class of read-modify-write operations defined for shared-memory
multiprocessor architectures. The class of read-modify-write operations is
important in solving consensus and related synchronization problems for
concurrency control. Local read-write is shown to be an atomic abstraction for
synchronizing neighborhood states in sensor networks. The paper compares local
read-write to similar lightweight operations in wireless sensor networks, such
as read-all, write-all, and a transaction-based abstraction: for some
optimistic scenarios, local read-write is a more efficient neighborhood
operation. A partial implementation is described, which shows that three
outcomes characterize operation response: success, failure, and cancel. A
failure response indicates possible inconsistency for the operation result,
which is the result of a timeout event at the operation's initiator. The paper

  Specifications","Developers rely on build systems to generate software from code. At a
minimum, a build system should produce build targets from a clean copy of the
code. However, developers rarely work from clean checkouts. Instead, they
rebuild software repeatedly, sometimes hundreds of times a day. To keep
rebuilds fast, build systems run incrementally, executing commands only when
built state cannot be reused. Existing tools like make present users with a
tradeoff. Simple build specifications are easy to write, but limit incremental
work. More complex build specifications produce faster incremental builds, but
writing them is labor-intensive and error-prone. This work shows that no such
tradeoff is necessary; build specifications can be both simple and fast.
  We introduce LaForge, a novel build tool that eliminates the need to specify
dependencies or incremental build steps. LaForge builds are easy to specify;
developers write a simple script that runs a full build. Even a single command
like gcc src/*.c will suffice. LaForge traces the execution of the build and
generates a transcript in the TraceIR language. On later builds, LaForge
evaluates the TraceIR transcript to detect changes and perform an efficient
incremental rebuild that automatically captures all build dependencies.
  We evaluate LaForge by building 14 software packages, including LLVM and
memcached. Our results show that LaForge automatically generates efficient
builds from simple build specifications. Full builds with LaForge have a median
overhead of 16.1% compared to a project's default full build. LaForge's

expressing them in terms of software components reused from libraries. A common
theme in the software reuse literature is that if we can only get the right
environment in place-- the right tools, the right generalizations, economic
incentives, a ``culture of reuse'' -- then reuse of software will soar, with
consequent improvements in productivity and software quality. The analysis
developed in this paper paints a different picture: the extent to which
software reuse can occur is an intrinsic property of a problem domain, and
better tools and culture can have only marginal impact on reuse rates if the
domain is inherently resistant to reuse. We define an entropy parameter $H \in
[0,1]$ of problem domains that measures program diversity, and deduce from this
upper bounds on code reuse and the scale of components with which we may work.
For ``low entropy'' domains with $H$ near 0, programs are highly similar to one
another and the domain is amenable to the Component-Based Software Engineering

emerges in consequence of nodes minimizing the ratio of their energy use to the

nested hierarchical clustering, which multiplies a network's capacity to use

For a real network in which the nodes have the capacity to exchange benefits,

token (called Wit), which miners-called witnesses-earn by retrieving, attesting

to pay witnesses for their Retrieve-Attest-Deliver (RAD) work. Witnesses also
compete to mine blocks with considerable rewards, but Witnet mining power is
proportional to their previous performance in terms of honesty and
trustworthiness-this is, their reputation as witnesses. This creates a powerful
incentive for witnesses to do their work honestly, protect their reputation and
not to deceive the network. The Witnet protocol is designed to assign the RAD
tasks to witnesses in a way that mitigates most attack vectors to the greatest
extent. At the same time, it includes a novel 'sharding' feature that (1)

clustering. While the task in Cluster Vertex Deletion is to delete vertices
from a graph so that its connected components become cliques, the task in
s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion is to delete vertices from a graph so that its
connected components become s-plexes. An s-plex is a graph in which every
vertex is nonadjacent to at most s-1 other vertices; a clique is an 1-plex. In
contrast to Cluster Vertex Deletion, s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion allows to
balance the number of vertex deletions against the sizes and the density of the
resulting clusters, which are s-plexes instead of cliques. The focus of this
work is the development of provably efficient and effective data reduction
rules for s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion. In terms of fixed-parameter
algorithmics, these yield a so-called problem kernel. A similar problem, s-Plex
Editing, where the task is the insertion or the deletion of edges so that the
connected components of a graph become s-plexes, has also been studied in terms
of fixed-parameter algorithmics. Using the number of allowed graph
modifications as parameter, we expect typical parameter values for s-Plex

and evolve in a social context - traditionally uses agent-based models to
validate the implications of sociological theories. These models encode the
causal mechanism that drives the opinion formation process, and have the
advantage of being easy to interpret. However, as they do not exploit the
availability of data, their predictive power is limited. Moreover, parameter
calibration and model selection are manual and difficult tasks.
  In this work we propose an inference mechanism for fitting a generative,
agent-like model of opinion dynamics to real-world social traces. Given a set
of observables (e.g., actions and interactions between agents), our model can
recover the most-likely latent opinion trajectories that are compatible with
the assumptions about the process dynamics. This type of model retains the
benefits of agent-based ones (i.e., causal interpretation), while adding the
ability to perform model selection and hypothesis testing on real data.
  We showcase our proposal by translating a classical agent-based model of
opinion dynamics into its generative counterpart. We then design an inference
algorithm based on online expectation maximization to learn the latent
parameters of the model. Such algorithm can recover the latent opinion
trajectories from traces generated by the classical agent-based model. In
addition, it can identify the most likely set of macro parameters used to
generate a data trace, thus allowing testing of sociological hypotheses.

partners or releasing data to the public is a frequent occurrence. Some of the
techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers,
alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches
suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information
can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other
information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact
these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we
propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN,
uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are
statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information
leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic
tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the
original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model
compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods
without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world
datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted in-depth

  Multilayer Approach","In this work, the aim is to study the spread of a contagious disease and
information on a multilayer social system. The main idea is to find a criterion
under which the adoption of the spreading information blocks or suppresses the
epidemic spread. A two-layer network is the base of the model. The first layer
describes the direct contact interactions, while the second layer is the
information propagation layer. Both layers consist of the same nodes. The
society consists of five different categories of individuals: susceptibles,
infective, recovered, vaccinated and precautioned. Initially, only one infected
individual starts transmitting the infection. Direct contact interactions
spread the infection to the susceptibles. The information spreads through the
second layer. The SIR model is employed for the infection spread, while the
Bass equation models the adoption of information. The control parameters of the
competition between the spread of information and spread of disease are the
topology and the density of connectivity. The topology of the information layer
is a scale-free network with increasing density of edges. In the contact layer,
regular and scale-free networks with the same average degree per node are used
interchangeably. The observation is that increasing complexity of the contact
network reduces the role of individual awareness. If the contact layer consists
of networks with limited range connections, or the edges sparser than the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05585v1,Model-Driven Automatic Tiling with Cache Associativity Lattices,"Traditional compiler optimization theory distinguishes three separate classes
of cache miss -- Cold, Conflict and Capacity. Tiling for cache is typically
guided by capacity miss counts. Models of cache function have not been
effectively used to guide cache tiling optimizations due to model error and
expense. Instead, heuristic or empirical approaches are used to select tilings.
We argue that conflict misses, traditionally neglected or seen as a small
constant effect, are the only fundamentally important cache miss category, that
they form a solid basis by which caches can become modellable, and that models
leaning on cache associatvity analysis can be used to generate cache performant
tilings. We develop a mathematical framework that expresses potential and
actual cache misses in associative caches using Associativity Lattices. We show
these lattices to possess two theoretical advantages over rectangular tiles --
volume maximization and miss regularity. We also show that to generate such
lattice tiles requires, unlike rectangular tiling, no explicit, expensive
lattice point counting. We also describe an implementation of our lattice
tiling approach, show that it can be used to give speedups of over 10x versus
unoptimized code, and despite currently only tiling for one level of cache, can
already be competitive with the aggressive compiler optimizations used in
general purposes compares such as GCC and Intel's ICC. We also show that the
tiling approach can lead to reasonable automatic parallelism when compared to
existing auto-threading compilers.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

fuzzy logic controller is designed according to rules so that the systems is
basically robust. There are 25 rules for the auto-tuning of each parameter of
the PID controller. The FLC (fuzzy logic controller) has two inputs. The first
is the motor speed error between the reference (setpoint) and the actual speed.
The second is the variation of the speed error (derivative of the speed error).
Secondly the output of the FLC is the parameters of the PID controller which
are used to control the speed of the DC motor. The study shows that both the
precise characters of PID controllers and the flexible characters of fuzzy
controllers are present in the fuzzy self-tuning PID controller. The fuzzy
auto-tuning approach implemented on a conventional PID structure was able to

  Social Norms","Humans are going to delegate the rights of driving to the autonomous vehicles
in near future. However, to fulfill this complicated task, there is a need for
a mechanism, which enforces the autonomous vehicles to obey the road and social
rules that have been practiced by well-behaved drivers. This task can be
achieved by introducing social norms compliance mechanism in the autonomous
vehicles. This research paper is proposing an artificial society of autonomous
vehicles as an analogy of human social society. Each AV has been assigned a
social personality having different social influence. Social norms have been
introduced which help the AVs in making the decisions, influenced by emotions,
regarding road collision avoidance. Furthermore, social norms compliance
mechanism, by artificial social AVs, has been proposed using prospect based
emotion i.e. fear, which is conceived from OCC model. Fuzzy logic has been
employed to compute the emotions quantitatively. Then, using SimConnect
approach, fuzzy values of fear has been provided to the Netlogo simulation
environment to simulate artificial society of AVs. Extensive testing has been
performed using the behavior space tool to find out the performance of the
proposed approach in terms of the number of collisions. For comparison, the
random-walk model based artificial society of AVs has been proposed as well. A
comparative study with a random walk, prove that proposed approach provides a
better option to tailor the autopilots of future AVS, Which will be more

obtained through an elementary pointwise transform of the input image. This has
a two-fold advantage. First, we can use fast recursive algorithms for computing

algebraic syntax for bigraphs, the bigraphical theory introduces a visual
concrete syntax which is intuitive and unambiguous at the same time; the
standard visual notation can be customized and thus tailored to domain-specific
requirements. However, in contrast to modeling standards based on the
Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and domain-specific languages typically used in
model-driven engineering (MDE), the bigraphical theory lacks a precise
definition of an abstract syntax for bigraphical modeling languages. As a
consequence, available modeling and analysis tools use proprietary formats for

of models across tool boundaries. Moreover, tools can be hardly integrated with
standard MDE technologies in order to build sophisticated tool chains and

periods. The physical time order is obeyed by any real execution in
multiprocessor systems due to that it is part of the truly happened operation
orders restricted by global clock, and it is then proven to be independent and
consistent with traditional logical time orders. The above novel yet
fundamental concepts enables new effective approaches for analyzing
multiprocessor systems, which are named \emph{pending period analysis} as a
whole. As a consequence of pending period analysis, many important problems of
multiprocessor systems can be tackled effectively. As a significant application
example, complete memory consistency verification, which was known as an
NP-hard problem, can be solved with the complexity of $O(n^2)$ (where $n$ is
the number of operations). Moreover, the two event ordering problems, which
were proven to be Co-NP-Hard and NP-hard respectively, can both be solved with
the time complexity of O(n) if restricted by pending period information.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Reinforcement Learning","Personalized image aesthetic assessment (PIAA) has recently become a hot
topic due to its usefulness in a wide variety of applications such as
photography, film and television, e-commerce, fashion design and so on. This
task is more seriously affected by subjective factors and samples provided by
users. In order to acquire precise personalized aesthetic distribution by small
amount of samples, we propose a novel user-guided personalized image aesthetic
assessment framework. This framework leverages user interactions to retouch and
rank images for aesthetic assessment based on deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), and generates personalized aesthetic distribution that is more in line
with the aesthetic preferences of different users. It mainly consists of two
stages. In the first stage, personalized aesthetic ranking is generated by
interactive image enhancement and manual ranking, meanwhile two policy networks
will be trained. The images will be pushed to the user for manual retouching
and simultaneously to the enhancement policy network. The enhancement network
utilizes the manual retouching results as the optimization goals of DRL. After
that, the ranking process performs the similar operations like the retouching
mentioned before. These two networks will be trained iteratively and
alternatively to help to complete the final personalized aesthetic assessment
automatically. In the second stage, these modified images are labeled with
aesthetic attributes by one style-specific classifier, and then the
personalized aesthetic distribution is generated based on the multiple
aesthetic attributes of these images, which conforms to the aesthetic

more convenient, but it has also raised many security concerns. Due to the
difficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of
IoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers
cannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing
processes, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even
impossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an
efficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing
domain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic
black-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client
communicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based
on the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that
reflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based
on message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the
probing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing
approaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only
inherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also
utilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore,
Snipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite
operations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on

is the semidirect product of C by the diagonal gain scaling matrix group D.
These results apply to the group lifting structures for the two principal
