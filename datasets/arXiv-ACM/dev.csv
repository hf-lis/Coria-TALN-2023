consists on building a function (a hypothesis) from a given amount of data (for
instance a decision tree or a neural network) such that we can use it
afterwards to predict new instances of the data. In this paper, we focus on a
particular situation where we assume that the hypothesis we want to use for
prediction is very simple, and thus, the hypotheses class is of feasible size.
We study the problem of how to determine which of the hypotheses in the class
is almost the best one. We present two on-line sampling algorithms for
selecting hypotheses, give theoretical bounds on the number of necessary
examples, and analize them exprimentally. We compare them with the simple batch

restraints from NMR, using convex optimization. It is well-known that the
NP-hard distance geometry problem of determining atomic positions from pairwise
distance restraints can be relaxed into a convex semidefinite program. Often
the NOE distance restraints are too imprecise and sparse for accurate structure
determination. Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements provide additional
geometric information on the angles between atom-pair directions and axes of
the principal-axis-frame. The optimization problem involving RDC is highly
non-convex and requires a good initialization even within the simulated
annealing framework. In this paper, we model the protein backbone as an
articulated structure composed of rigid units. Determining the rotation of each
rigid unit gives the full protein structure. We propose solving the non-convex
optimization problems using the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy. The two
algorithms - RDC-SOS and RDC-NOE-SOS, have polynomial time complexity in the
number of amino-acid residues and run efficiently on a standard desktop. In
many instances, the proposed methods exactly recover the solution to the

Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), to provide an information theoretic bound on the
highest resolution one can hope to achieve when determining protein structure
from noisy measurements using any methodology. Our simulation results show that
when the RDC measurements are corrupted by Gaussian noise of realistic

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01835v3,Stable-Unstable Semantics: Beyond NP with Normal Logic Programs,"Standard answer set programming (ASP) targets at solving search problems from
the first level of the polynomial time hierarchy (PH). Tackling search problems
beyond NP using ASP is less straightforward. The class of disjunctive logic
programs offers the most prominent way of reaching the second level of the PH,
but encoding respective hard problems as disjunctive programs typically
requires sophisticated techniques such as saturation or meta-interpretation.
The application of such techniques easily leads to encodings that are
inaccessible to non-experts. Furthermore, while disjunctive ASP solvers often
rely on calls to a (co-)NP oracle, it may be difficult to detect from the input
program where the oracle is being accessed. In other formalisms, such as
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs), the interface to the underlying oracle is
more transparent as it is explicitly recorded in the quantifier prefix of a
formula. On the other hand, ASP has advantages over QBFs from the modeling
perspective. The rich high-level languages such as ASP-Core-2 offer a wide
variety of primitives that enable concise and natural encodings of search
problems. In this paper, we present a novel logic programming--based modeling
paradigm that combines the best features of ASP and QBFs. We develop so-called
combined logic programs in which oracles are directly cast as (normal) logic
programs themselves. Recursive incarnations of this construction enable logic
programming on arbitrarily high levels of the PH. We develop a proof-of-concept
implementation for our new paradigm.

the issue of a patch. One way to mitigate this window of vulnerability is to
use a configuration workaround, which prevents the vulnerable code from being
executed at the cost of some lost functionality -- but only if one is
available. Since program configurations are not specifically designed to
mitigate software vulnerabilities, we find that they only cover 25.2% of
vulnerabilities.
  To minimize patch delay vulnerabilities and address the limitations of
configuration workarounds, we propose Security Workarounds for Rapid Response
(SWRRs), which are designed to neutralize security vulnerabilities in a timely,
secure, and unobtrusive manner. Similar to configuration workarounds, SWRRs
neutralize vulnerabilities by preventing vulnerable code from being executed at
the cost of some lost functionality. However, the key difference is that SWRRs
use existing error-handling code within programs, which enables them to be
mechanically inserted with minimal knowledge of the program and minimal
developer effort. This allows SWRRs to achieve high coverage while still being
fast and easy to deploy.
  We have designed and implemented Talos, a system that mechanically
instruments SWRRs into a given program, and evaluate it on five popular Linux

measurements on 320 SWRRs indicate that SWRRs instrumented by Talos can
neutralize 75.1% of all potential vulnerabilities and incur a loss of

process which allows one to make money by producing bitcoins. We reformulate
this problem as a Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and
reduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem. We estimate the speed of
this process and we show that the cost of this process is less than it seems
and it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which we estimated to be at
most 1.86. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save tens of millions
of dollars per year in electricity bills. Miners who set up mining operations
face many economic incertitudes such as high volatility. In this paper we point
out that there are fundamental incertitudes which depend very strongly on the
bitcoin specification. The energy efficiency of bitcoin miners have already
been improved by a factor of about 10,000, and we claim that further
improvements are inevitable. Better technology is bound to be invented, would

subpaths of the graph. These anchor matches are then combined to form a
(semi-local) alignment of the complete read on a subpath. Co-linear chaining is
an algorithmically rigorous approach to combine the anchors. It is a well-known
approach for the case of two sequences as inputs. Here we extend the approach
so that one of the inputs can be a directed acyclic graph (DAGs), e.g. a
splicing graph in transcriptomics or a variant graph in pan-genomics.
  This extension to DAGs turns out to have a tight connection to the minimum
path cover problem, asking for a minimum-cardinality set of paths that cover
all the nodes of a DAG. We study the case when the size $k$ of a minimum path
cover is small, which is often the case in practice. First, we propose an
algorithm for finding a minimum path cover of a DAG $(V,E)$ in $O(k|E|\log|V|)$
time, improving all known time-bounds when $k$ is small and the DAG is not too
dense. Second, we introduce a general technique for extending dynamic
programming (DP) algorithms from sequences to DAGs. This is enabled by our
minimum path cover algorithm, and works by mimicking the DP algorithm for
sequences on each path of the minimum path cover. This technique generally
produces algorithms that are slower than their counterparts on sequences only
by a factor $k$. Our technique can be applied, for example, to the classical
longest increasing subsequence and longest common subsequence problems,
extended to labeled DAGs. Finally, we apply this technique to the co-linear
chaining problem. We also implemented the new co-linear chaining approach.
Experiments on splicing graphs show that the new method is efficient also in
practice.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Streaming","This paper aims to reduce the prebuffering requirements, while maintaining
continuity, for video streaming. Current approaches do this by making use of
adaptive media playout (AMP) to reduce the playout rate. However, this
introduces playout distortion to the viewers and increases the viewing latency.
We approach this by proposing a frame rate optimization framework that adjusts
both the encoder frame generation rate and the decoder playout frame rate.
Firstly, we model this problem as the joint adjustment of the encoder frame
generation interval and the decoder playout frame interval. This model is used
with a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer to track the accumulated difference
between the receiving frame interval and the playout frame interval. We then
apply Lyapunov optimization to the model to systematically derive a pair of
decoupled optimization policies. We show that the occupancy of the
discontinuity penalty virtual buffer is correlated to the video discontinuity
and that this framework produces a very low playout distortion in addition to a
significant reduction in the prebuffering requirements compared to existing
approaches. Secondly, we introduced a delay constraint into the framework by
using a delay accumulator virtual buffer. Simulation results show that the the
delay constrained framework provides a superior tradeoff between the video
quality and the delay introduced compared to the existing approach. Finally, we
analyzed the impact of delayed feedback between the receiver and the sender on

found that the universal validity of many properties of automata depend heavily
upon the distributivity of the underlying logic. This indicates that these
properties does not universally hold in the realm of quantum logic. On the

  In order to obtain this result, we extend the technique of Das Sarma et al.
[SICOMP 2012] to obtain a uniform approach to prove non-trivial lower bounds
for quantum distributed algorithms for several graph optimization (both exact
and approximate versions) as well as verification problems, some of which are
new even in the classical setting, e.g. tight randomized lower bounds for
Hamiltonian cycle and spanning tree verification, answering an open problem of
Das Sarma et al., and a lower bound in terms of the weight aspect ratio,
matching the upper bounds of Elkin [STOC 2004]. Our approach introduces the
{\em Server model} and {\em Quantum Simulation Theorem} which together provide
a connection between distributed algorithms and communication complexity. The
Server model is the standard two-party communication complexity model augmented
with additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is

of a wireless node that may be used to form a mobile ad hoc network that

how those functionalities can be incorporated. A feature of our architecture is
that the node has the ability to utilize multiple paths, if available, for the
provision of QoS. However, in the absence of multiple paths it can utilize the
resources provided by a single path between the source and the destination. We
follow a modular approach where each module is expanded iteratively. We compare

  Search","This article presents the long-term behaviour analysis of Stochastic
Diffusion Search (SDS), a distributed agent-based system for best-fit pattern
matching. SDS operates by allocating simple agents into different regions of
the search space. Agents independently pose hypotheses about the presence of
the pattern in the search space and its potential distortion. Assuming a
compositional structure of hypotheses about pattern matching agents perform an
inference on the basis of partial evidence from the hypothesised solution.
Agents posing mutually consistent hypotheses about the pattern support each
other and inhibit agents with inconsistent hypotheses. This results in the
emergence of a stable agent population identifying the desired solution.
Positive feedback via diffusion of information between the agents significantly
contributes to the speed with which the solution population is formed. The
formulation of the SDS model in terms of interacting Markov Chains enables its
characterisation in terms of the allocation of agents, or computational
resources. The analysis characterises the stationary probability distribution
of the activity of agents, which leads to the characterisation of the solution

research has shown that unless the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis (OVH) is
false, one cannot solve this problem in strongly sub-quadratic time, nor index
the graph in polynomial time to answer queries efficiently (Equi et al. ICALP
2019, SOFSEM 2021). These conditional lower-bounds cover even deterministic
graphs with binary alphabet, but there naturally exist also graph classes that
are easy to index: E.g. Wheeler graphs (Gagie et al. Theor. Comp. Sci. 2017)
cover graphs admitting a Burrows-Wheeler transform -based indexing scheme.
However, it is NP-complete to recognize if a graph is a Wheeler graph (Gibney,
Thankachan, ESA 2019).
  We propose an approach to alleviate the construction bottleneck of Wheeler
graphs. Rather than starting from an arbitrary graph, we study graphs induced
from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Elastic degenerate strings (Bernadini
et al. SPIRE 2017, ICALP 2019) can be seen as such graphs, and we introduce
here their generalization: elastic founder graphs. We first prove that even
such induced graphs are hard to index under OVH. Then we introduce two
subclasses, repeat-free and semi-repeat-free graphs, that are easy to index. We
give a linear time algorithm to construct a repeat-free non-elastic founder
graph from a gapless MSA, and (parameterized) near-linear time algorithms to
construct semi-repeat-free (repeat-free, respectively) elastic founder graphs

to express some specific concepts are components of a larger formal description
of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast
collection of concepts, formalisms, and results found in the literature into a
unified framework, which we call TVG (for time-varying graphs). Using this
framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only
the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to
each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and
original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each
class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed
computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the
evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on

to succinctly formulate and efficiently solve complex problems. An intuitive
extension of this formalism is communicating ASP, in which multiple ASP
programs collaborate to solve the problem at hand. However, the expressiveness
of communicating ASP has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we present
a systematic study of the additional expressiveness offered by allowing ASP
programs to communicate. First, we consider a simple form of communication
where programs are only allowed to ask questions to each other. For the most
part, we deliberately only consider simple programs, i.e. programs for which
computing the answer sets is in P. We find that the problem of deciding whether
a literal is in some answer set of a communicating ASP program using simple
communication is NP-hard. In other words: we move up a step in the polynomial
hierarchy due to the ability of these simple ASP programs to communicate and
collaborate. Second, we modify the communication mechanism to also allow us to
focus on a sequence of communicating programs, where each program in the
sequence may successively remove some of the remaining models. This mimics a
network of leaders, where the first leader has the first say and may remove
models that he or she finds unsatisfactory. Using this particular communication
mechanism allows us to capture the entire polynomial hierarchy. This means, in
particular, that communicating ASP could be used to solve problems that are

shown that the optimal charging schedule smooths out the energy consumption
over time so as to minimize the total energy cost. In practice, however, it is
hard to smooth out the energy consumption perfectly, because the future PEV
charging demand is unknown at the moment when the charging rate of an existing
PEV needs to be determined. In this paper, we propose an Online cooRdinated

knowing the future information. Through rigorous proof, we show that ORCHARD is
strictly feasible in the sense that it guarantees to fulfill all charging
demands before due time. Meanwhile, it achieves the best known competitive
ratio of 2.39. To further reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm,
we propose a novel reduced-complexity algorithm to replace the standard convex
optimization techniques used in ORCHARD. Through extensive simulations, we show
that the average performance gap between ORCHARD and the offline optimal

abstraction as an object calculus with primitives for defining and calling web

validate our semantics, we embed correspondence assertions that specify the

by a set of selfish peers. Each peer has the ability to change the network in a
limited way, e.g., by creating or deleting incident links. In doing so, a peer
can reduce its individual communication cost. Typically, these costs are
modeled by the maximum or average distance in the network. We introduce a
generalized version of the basic network creation game (BNCG). In the BNCG (by
Alon et al., SPAA 2010), each peer may replace one of its incident links by a
link to an arbitrary peer. This is done in a selfish way in order to minimize
either the maximum or average distance to all other peers. That is, each peer
works towards a network structure that allows himself to communicate
efficiently with all other peers. However, participants of large networks are
seldom interested in all peers. Rather, they want to communicate efficiently
only with a small subset of peers. Our model incorporates these (communication)
interests explicitly. In the MAX-version, each node tries to minimize its
maximum distance to nodes it is interested in.
  Given peers with interests and a communication network forming a tree, we
prove several results on the structure and quality of equilibria in our model.
For the MAX-version, we give an upper worst case bound of O(\sqrt{n}) for the
private costs in an equilibrium of n peers. Moreover, we give an equilibrium
for a circular interest graph where a node has private cost \Omega(\sqrt{n}),
showing that our bound is tight. This example can be extended such that we get
a tight bound of \Theta(\sqrt{n}) for the price of anarchy. For the case of
general communication networks we show the price of anarchy to be \Theta(n).

the Deterministic Annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm's authors make great efforts to
eliminate locally maximal Q for avoiding L's local convergence. However, this
paper proves that in some cases, Q may and should decrease for L to increase;
slow or local convergence exists only because of small samples and unfair
competition. This paper uses marriage competition to explain different
convergence difficulties and proposes the Fair Competition Principle (FCP) with
an initialization map for improving initializations. It uses the
rate-verisimilitude function, extended from the rate-distortion function, to
explain the convergence of the EM and improved EM algorithms. This convergence
proof adopts variational and iterative methods that Shannon et al. used for
analyzing rate-distortion functions. The initialization map can vastly save
both algorithms' running times for binary Gaussian mixtures. The FCP and the
initialization map are useful for complicated mixtures but not sufficient; we

  Random Satisfiability","Satisfiability is considered the canonical NP-complete problem and is used as
a starting point for hardness reductions in theory, while in practice heuristic
SAT solving algorithms can solve large-scale industrial SAT instances very
efficiently. This disparity between theory and practice is believed to be a
result of inherent properties of industrial SAT instances that make them
tractable. Two characteristic properties seem to be prevalent in the majority
of real-world SAT instances, heterogeneous degree distribution and locality. To
understand the impact of these two properties on SAT, we study the proof
complexity of random k-SAT models that allow to control heterogeneity and
locality. Our findings show that heterogeneity alone does not make SAT easy as
heterogeneous random k-SAT instances have superpolynomial resolution size. This
implies intractability of these instances for modern SAT-solvers. On the other
hand, modeling locality with an underlying geometry leads to small
unsatisfiable subformulas, which can be found within polynomial time.
  A key ingredient for the result on geometric random k-SAT can be found in the
complexity of higher-order Voronoi diagrams. As an additional technical
contribution, we show a linear upper bound on the number of non-empty Voronoi
regions, that holds for points with random positions in a very general setting.

  Power Control in the SINR Model","In modern wireless networks, devices are able to set the power for each
transmission carried out. Experimental but also theoretical results indicate
that such power control can improve the network capacity significantly. We
study this problem in the physical interference model using SINR constraints.
  In the SINR capacity maximization problem, we are given n pairs of senders
and receivers, located in a metric space (usually a so-called fading metric).
The algorithm shall select a subset of these pairs and choose a power level for
each of them with the objective of maximizing the number of simultaneous
communications. This is, the selected pairs have to satisfy the SINR
constraints with respect to the chosen powers.
  We present the first algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation in
fading metrics. The best previous results depend on further network parameters
such as the ratio of the maximum and the minimum distance between a sender and
its receiver. Expressed only in terms of n, they are (trivial) Omega(n)
approximations.
  Our algorithm still achieves an O(log n) approximation if we only assume to
have a general metric space rather than a fading metric. Furthermore, by using
standard techniques the algorithm can also be used in single-hop and multi-hop
scheduling scenarios. Here, we also get polylog(n) approximations.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(S_i)_{i\in [1,k]}$ of $V(G)$ into $k$ stable sets $S_1,\ldots, S_{k}$. Given a
weight function $w: V(G) \to \mathbb{R}^+$, the weight of a color $S_i$ is
defined as $w(i) = \max_{v \in S_i} w(v)$ and the weight of a coloring $c$ as
$w(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}w(i)$. Guan and Zhu [Inf. Process. Lett., 1997] defined
the weighted chromatic number of a pair $(G,w)$, denoted by $\sigma(G,w)$, as
the minimum weight of a proper coloring of $G$. The problem of determining
$\sigma(G,w)$ has received considerable attention during the last years, and
has been proved to be notoriously hard: for instance, it is NP-hard on split
graphs, unsolvable on $n$-vertex trees in time $n^{o(\log n)}$ unless the ETH
fails, and W[1]-hard on forests parameterized by the size of a largest tree. In
this article we provide some positive results for the problem, by considering
its so-called dual parameterization: given a vertex-weighted graph $(G,w)$ and
an integer $k$, the question is whether $\sigma(G,w) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)}
w(v) - k$. We prove that this problem is FPT by providing an algorithm running
in time $9^k \cdot n^{O(1)}$, and it is easy to see that no algorithm in time
$2^{o(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ exists under the ETH. On the other hand, we present a
kernel with at most $(2^{k-1}+1) (k-1)$ vertices, and we rule out the existence
of polynomial kernels unless ${\sf NP} \subseteq {\sf coNP} / {\sf poly}$, even
on split graphs with only two different weights. Finally, we identify some

finite automaton (DFA) is called synchronizing if $w$ sends all states of the
automaton to a unique state. J. \v{C}erny discovered in 1964 a sequence of
$n$-state complete DFA possessing a minimal synchronizing word of length
$(n-1)^2$. The hypothesis, well known today as the \v{C}erny conjecture, claims
that it is also precise upper bound on the length of such a word for a complete
DFA. The hypothesis was formulated in 1966 by Starke. The problem has motivated
great and constantly growing number of investigations and generalizations. To
prove the conjecture, we use algebra w on a special class of row monomial
matrices (one unit and rest zeros in every row), induced by words in the
alphabet of labels on edges. These matrices generate a space with respect to
the mentioned operation. The proof is based on connection between length of
words $u$ and dimension of the space generated by solutions $L_x$ of matrix
equation $M_uL_x=M_s$ for synchronizing word $s$, as well as on the relation

for quite a few other problems for Boolean constraints.Almost all of these
problems are variations of the satisfiability problem.
  In this paper, we address a problem that is not a variation of

Previous work by B\""ohler et al. showed that the isomorphism problem is either
coNP-hard or reducible to the graph isomorphism problem (a problem that is in
NP, but not known to be NP-hard), thus distinguishing a hard case and an easier
case. However, they did not classify which cases are truly easy, i.e., in P.

at each time $t$, the sender observes a payoff-relevant state drawn
independently and identically from an unknown prior distribution, and shares
state information with the receiver, who then myopically chooses an action. As
in the standard setting, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver into
choosing actions that are aligned with the sender's preference by selectively
sharing information about the state. However, in contrast to the standard
models, the sender does not know the prior, and has to persuade while gradually
learning the prior on the fly.
  We study the sender's learning problem of making persuasive action
recommendations to achieve low regret against the optimal persuasion mechanism
with the knowledge of the prior distribution. Our main positive result is an
algorithm that, with high probability, is persuasive across all rounds and
achieves $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ regret, where $T$ is the horizon length. The core
philosophy behind the design of our algorithm is to leverage robustness against
the sender's ignorance of the prior. Intuitively, at each time our algorithm
maintains a set of candidate priors, and chooses a persuasion scheme that is
simultaneously persuasive for all of them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm, we further prove that no algorithm can achieve regret better
than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, even if the persuasiveness requirements were
significantly relaxed. Therefore, our algorithm achieves optimal regret for the

a monadic first-order logic over difference inequalities, which we call monadic
difference logic. Second, at each step of the timed run, the monadic difference
formula is modified by computing a quotient with the state and time of that

unsatisfiable by a decision procedure for monadic difference logic.
  We further provide a simple decision procedure for monadic difference logic

of humans supported by a computer alerting tool can be improved by tailoring
the tool's alerting threshold (sensitivity/specificity combination) according
to user ability and task difficulty. Background: Many researchers implicitly
assume that for each tool there exists a single ideal threshold. But research
shows the effects of alerting tools on decision errors to vary depending on
variables such as user ability and task difficulty. These findings motivated
our investigation. Method: Forty-seven participants edited text passages, aided
by a simulated spell-checker tool. We experimentally manipulated passage
difficulty and tool alerting threshold, measured participants' editing and
dictation ability, and counted participants' decision errors (false positives +
false negatives). We investigated whether alerting threshold, user ability,
task difficulty and their interactions affected error count. Results: Which
alerting threshold better helped a user depended on an interaction between user
ability and passage difficulty. Some effects were large: for higher ability
users, a more sensitive threshold reduced errors by 30%, on the easier
passages. Participants were not significantly more likely to prefer the
alerting threshold with which they performed better. Conclusion: Adjusting
alerting thresholds for individual users' ability and task difficulty could
substantially improve effects of automated alerts on user decisions. This
potential deserves further investigation. Improvement size and rules for
adjustment will be application-specific. Application: Computer alerting tools
have critical roles in many domains. Designers should assess potential benefits

  and other Systems","More often than not, there is a need to understand the structure of complex
computer code: what functions and in what order they are called, how
information travels around static, input, and output variables, what depends on
what. As a rule, executable code and data are scattered among multiple files
and even multiple modules. Information is transmitted among variables which
often change names. These tangled relations greatly complicate the development,
maintenance, and redevelopment of code, its analysis for complexity and its
robustness. As of now, there is no tool which is capable of presenting the
real-life, useful diagram of actual code. Conventional flowcharts fail.
Proposed is the method which overcomes these difficulties. The main idea is
that functionality of software can be described through flows of control, which
is essentially flows of time, and flows of data. These are inseparable. The
second idea is to follow very strict system boundaries and distinctions with
respect to modules, functions, blocks, and operators, as well as data holders,
showing them all as subsystems, in other words, by clearly expressing the
system structure when every piece of executable code and every variable may
have its own graphical representation. The third is defining timelines as the
entities clearly separated from the connected blocks of code. Timelines allow

  Comprehension (I) : Bootstrapping Meaning from Episodic Narrative viewed as a
  Feature Landscape","The problem of extracting important and meaningful parts of a sensory data
stream, without prior training, is studied for symbolic sequences, by using
textual narrative as a test case. This is part of a larger study concerning the
extraction of concepts from spacetime processes, and their knowledge
representations within hybrid symbolic-learning `Artificial Intelligence'. Most
approaches to text analysis make extensive use of the evolved human sense of
language and semantics. In this work, streams are parsed without knowledge of
semantics, using only measurable patterns (size and time) within the changing
stream of symbols -- as an event `landscape'. This is a form of interferometry.
Using lightweight procedures that can be run in just a few seconds on a single
CPU, this work studies the validity of the Semantic Spacetime Hypothesis, for
the extraction of concepts as process invariants. This `semantic preprocessor'
may then act as a front-end for more sophisticated long-term graph-based
learning techniques. The results suggest that what we consider important and
interesting about sensory experience is not solely based on higher reasoning,
but on simple spacetime process cues, and this may be how cognitive processing
is bootstrapped in the beginning.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  conditioning from inertial sensors","Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors are present in everyday devices such
as smartphones and fitness watches. As a result, the array of health-related
research and applications that tap onto this data has been growing, but little
attention has been devoted to the prediction of an individual's heart rate (HR)
from IMU data, when undergoing a physical activity. Would that be even
possible? If so, this could be used to design personalized sets of aerobic
exercises, for instance. In this work, we show that it is viable to obtain
accurate HR predictions from IMU data using Recurrent Neural Networks, provided
only access to HR and IMU data from a short-lived, previously executed
activity. We propose a novel method for initializing an RNN's hidden state
vectors, using a specialized network that attempts to extract an embedding of
the physical conditioning (PCE) of a subject. We show that using a
discriminator in the training phase to help the model learn whether two PCEs
belong to the same individual further reduces the prediction error. We evaluate
the proposed model when predicting the HR of 23 subjects performing a variety
of physical activities from IMU data available in public datasets (PAMAP2,
PPG-DaLiA). For comparison, we use as baselines the only model specifically
proposed for this task and an adapted state-of-the-art model for Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a closely related task. Our method, PCE-LSTM, yields over
10% lower mean absolute error. We demonstrate empirically that this error
reduction is in part due to the use of the PCE. Last, we use the two datasets

the art in BioNLP still leaves much room for improvement. Progress in BioNLP
research depends on large, annotated corpora for evaluating information
extraction systems and training machine learning models. Traditionally, such
corpora are created by small numbers of expert annotators often working over
extended periods of time. Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask
crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in
aggregate, generate high-quality annotations of biomedical text. Here, we
investigated the use of the AMT in capturing disease mentions in PubMed

benchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol. After several iterations, we arrived
at a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the

combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06

points in a structure such that, given a query rectangle Q = [a_1, a_2] x [b_1,
b_2], the maxima (a.k.a. skyline) of P \cap Q can be reported efficiently. The
query is 3-sided if an edge of Q is grounded, giving rise to two variants:
top-open (b_2 = \infty) and left-open (a_1 = -\infty) queries.
  All our results are in external memory under the O(n/B) space budget, for
both the static and dynamic settings:
  * For static P, we give structures that answer top-open queries in O(log_B n
+ k/B), O(loglog_B U + k/B), and O(1 + k/B) I/Os when the universe is R^2, a U
x U grid, and a rank space grid [O(n)]^2, respectively (where k is the number
of reported points). The query complexity is optimal in all cases.
  * We show that the left-open case is harder, such that any linear-size
structure must incur \Omega((n/B)^e + k/B) I/Os for a query. We show that this
case is as difficult as the general 4-sided queries, for which we give a static
structure with the optimal query cost O((n/B)^e + k/B).
  * We give a dynamic structure that supports top-open queries in O(log_2B^e
(n/B) + k/B^1-e) I/Os, and updates in O(log_2B^e (n/B)) I/Os, for any e
satisfying 0 \le e \le 1. This leads to a dynamic structure for 4-sided queries
with optimal query cost O((n/B)^e + k/B), and amortized update cost O(log

homological properties of the zero set of a continuous map $f:K\to R^n$ on a
compact space K that are invariant with respect to perturbations of f. The
perturbations are arbitrary continuous maps within $L_\infty$ distance r from f
for a given r>0. The main drawback of the approach is that the computability of
well groups was shown only when dim K=n or n=1.
  Our contribution to the theory of well groups is twofold: on the one hand we
improve on the computability issue, but on the other hand we present a range of
examples where the well groups are incomplete invariants, that is, fail to
capture certain important robust properties of the zero set.
  For the first part, we identify a computable subgroup of the well group that
is obtained by cap product with the pullback of the orientation of R^n by f. In
other words, well groups can be algorithmically approximated from below. When f
is smooth and dim K<2n-2, our approximation of the (dim K-n)th well group is
exact.
  For the second part, we find examples of maps $f,f': K\to R^n$ with all well
groups isomorphic but whose perturbations have different zero sets. We discuss

rich data set for advancing the state-of-the-art in RGBD- based 3D object pose
estimation, which is focused on the challenges that arise when solving

thousands of images and corresponding ground truth data for the objects used

in the evaluation of algorithms for object detection. To show the utility of
the data set, a recent algorithm for RGBD-based pose estimation is evaluated in
this paper. Based on the measured performance of the algorithm on the data set,
various modifications and improvements are applied to increase the accuracy of

uncompensated biases, the steady-state feedback rebalances those biases and can
be used to estimate them. At the second stage, the desired bias estimates are
expressed in a closed form in terms of the feedback signal. The estimator has

make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for

interesting succinct binary tree representations. There are four symmetric
versions of these transformations. Via these transformations we get four

n)^{O(1)}$ bits and support (among other operations) navigation, inorder
numbering, one of pre- or post-order numbering, subtree size and lowest common
ancestor (LCA) queries. The ability to support inorder numbering is crucial for
the well-known range-minimum query (RMQ) problem on an array $A$ of $n$ ordered

regular interval to stay competitive in the market. These bugs and features are
reported as change requests (i.e., technical documents written by software

the query with a code search engine (e.g., Lucene) and attempt to find out the
exact locations within the software code that need to be changed.

  (M&M)","One of the most important metrics in the design of IP mobility protocols is
the handover performance. The current Mobile IP (MIP) standard has been shown
to exhibit poor handover performance. Most other work attempts to modify MIP to
slightly improve its efficiency, while others propose complex techniques to
replace MIP. Rather than taking these approaches, we instead propose a new
architecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to
co-exist and inter-operate with other technologies. Specifically, we propose an
intra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is
assigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain. Efficient
handover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms. Two
approaches are proposed and contrasted. The first introduces the concept
proxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the
multicast address of visiting mobiles. We show that the algorithmic mapping
approach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms
to support it. Network simulation (using NS-2) is used to evaluate our scheme
and compare it to other routing-based micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII.
The proactive handover results show that both M&M and CIP shows low handoff
delay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII. The reason for M&M's
comparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover.
The M&M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails.

software developers' productivity and software quality is to focus on people.
The underlying assumption seems to be that ""happy and satisfied software

an impact on cognitive activities and the working performance of individuals.
Development tasks are undertaken heavily through cognitive processes, yet
software engineering research (SE) lacks theory on affects and their impact on
software development activities. This PhD dissertation supports the advocates
of studying the human and social aspects of SE and the psychology of
programming. This dissertation aims to theorize on the link between affects and
software development performance. A mixed method approach was employed, which
comprises studies of the literature in psychology and SE, quantitative
experiments, and a qualitative study, for constructing a multifaceted theory of
the link between affects and programming performance. The theory explicates the
linkage between affects and analytical problem-solving performance of
developers, their software development task productivity, and the process
behind the linkage. The results are novel in the domains of SE and psychology,
and they fill an important lack that had been raised by both previous research
and by practitioners. The implications of this PhD lie in setting out the basic
building blocks for researching and understanding the affect of software
developers, and how it is related to software development performance. Overall,

rich representations, often learned via modern function approximation
techniques, can enable practical application of the policy improvement theorem,
even in high-dimensional continuous state-action spaces. Bisimulation metrics
offer one solution to this representation learning problem, by collapsing
functionally similar states together in representation space, which promotes
invariance to noise and distractors. In this work, we generalize value function
approximation bounds for on-policy bisimulation metrics to non-optimal policies
and approximate environment dynamics. Our theoretical results help us identify
embedding pathologies that may occur in practical use. In particular, we find
that these issues stem from an underconstrained dynamics model and an unstable
dependence of the embedding norm on the reward signal in environments with
sparse rewards. Further, we propose a set of practical remedies: (i) a norm
constraint on the representation space, and (ii) an extension of prior
approaches with intrinsic rewards and latent space regularization. Finally, we

connections as indexing terms, and generates meaningful results sets by biasing
towards close social connections in a constrained optimization fashion. The

  information-flow security","It is common to prove by reasoning over source code that programs do not leak
sensitive data. But doing so leaves a gap between reasoning and reality that
can only be filled by accounting for the behaviour of the compiler. This task
is complicated when programs enforce value-dependent information-flow security
properties (in which classification of locations can vary depending on values
in other locations) and complicated further when programs exploit
shared-variable concurrency.
  Prior work has formally defined a notion of concurrency-aware refinement for
preserving value-dependent security properties. However, that notion is
considerably more complex than standard refinement definitions typically
applied in the verification of semantics preservation by compilers. To date it
remains unclear whether it can be applied to a realistic compiler, because
there exist no general decomposition principles for separating it into smaller,
more familiar, proof obligations.
  In this work, we provide such a decomposition principle, which we show can
almost halve the complexity of proving secure refinement. Further, we
demonstrate its applicability to secure compilation, by proving in Isabelle/HOL
the preservation of value-dependent security by a proof-of-concept compiler
from an imperative While language to a generic RISC-style assembly language,
for programs with shared-memory concurrency mediated by locking primitives.

has begun to see increased attention. Of particular interest in many
environments is debloating commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) software, which is
most commonly made available to end users as stripped binaries (i.e., neither
source code nor symbol-table/debugging information is available). Toward this
end, we created a system, called GenXGen[MC], that specializes stripped
binaries.
  Many aspects of the debloating problem can be addressed via techniques from
the literature on partial evaluation. However, applying such techniques to
real-world programs, particularly stripped binaries, involves non-trivial
state-management manipulations that have never been addressed in a completely
satisfactory manner in previous systems. In particular, a partial evaluator
needs to be able to (i) save and restore arbitrary program states, and (ii)
determine whether a program state is equal to one that arose earlier. Moreover,
to specialize stripped binaries, the system must also be able to handle program
states consisting of memory that is undifferentiated beyond the standard coarse
division into regions for the stack, the heap, and global data.
  This paper presents a new approach to state management in a program
specializer. The technique has been incorporated into GenXGen[MC], a novel tool
for producing machine-code generating extensions. Our experiments show that our

a key role in tuning performance, power consumption, and timing accuracy of
applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). Subsystems governing the
underlying clock tree must nonetheless cope with a huge parameter space,
complex dependencies, and dynamic constraints. Manufacturers expose the
underlying functions in very diverse ways, which leads to specialized
implementations of low portability. In this paper, we propose FlexClock, an
approach for generic online clock reconfiguration on constrained IoT devices.
We argue that (costly) generic clock configuration of general purpose computers
and powerful mobile devices need to slim down to the lower end of the device
spectrum. In search of a generalized solution, we identify recurring patterns
and building blocks, which we use to decompose clock trees into independent,
reusable components. With this segmentation we derive an abstract
representation of vendor-specific clock trees, which then can be dynamically
reconfigured at runtime. We evaluate our implementation on common hardware. Our
measurements demonstrate how FlexClock significantly improves peak power

  Habitability Assessment Using Machine Learning Approaches","We are at a unique timeline in the history of human evolution where we may be
able to discover earth-like planets around stars outside our solar system where
conditions can support life or even find evidence of life on those planets.
With the launch of several satellites in recent years by NASA, ESA, and other
major space agencies, an ample amount of datasets are at our disposal which can
be utilized to train machine learning models that can automate the arduous
tasks of exoplanet detection, its identification, and habitability
determination. Automating these tasks can save a considerable amount of time
and minimize human errors due to manual intervention. To achieve this aim, we
first analyze the light intensity curves from stars captured by the Kepler
telescope to detect the potential curves that exhibit the characteristics of an
existence of a possible planetary system. For this detection, along with
training conventional models, we propose a stacked GBDT model that can be
trained on multiple representations of the light signals simultaneously.
Subsequently, we address the automation of exoplanet identification and
habitability determination by leveraging several state-of-art machine learning
and ensemble approaches. The identification of exoplanets aims to distinguish
false positive instances from the actual instances of exoplanets whereas the
habitability assessment groups the exoplanet instances into different clusters
based on their habitable characteristics. Additionally, we propose a new metric
called Adequate Thermal Adequacy (ATA) score to establish a potential linear
relationship between habitable and non-habitable instances. Experimental
results suggest that the proposed stacked GBDT model outperformed the
conventional models in detecting transiting exoplanets. Furthermore, the

inter-linked RDF datasets from various domains. In this environment,
organizations and companies adopt the Linked Data practices utilizing Semantic
Web (SW) technologies, in order to publish their data and offer SPARQL
endpoints (i.e., SPARQL-based search services). On the other hand, the dominant
standard for information exchange in the Web today is XML. The SW and XML
worlds and their developed infrastructures are based on different data models,

mechanisms that allow the Web of Data users to access XML datasets, using
SPARQL, from their own working environments. It is unrealistic to expect that
all the existing legacy data (e.g., Relational, XML, etc.) will be transformed
into SW data. Therefore, publishing legacy data as Linked Data and providing
SPARQL endpoints over them has become a major research challenge. In this
direction, we introduce the SPARQL2XQuery Framework which creates an
interoperable environment, where SPARQL queries are automatically translated to
XQuery queries, in order to access XML data across the Web. The SPARQL2XQuery

from failure cases. Our hypothesis is that policy uncertainties can implicitly
indicate the potential failures in the visuomotor control task and that robot
states with minimum uncertainty are more likely to lead to task success. To
recover from high uncertainty cases, the robot monitors its uncertainty along a
trajectory and explores possible actions in the state-action space to bring

  To help the administrator to maintain his filters, we have developed a method

categorised as relevant or not relevant by the rule-based filter. The idea is
to supervise this filter by processing a differential comparison of its
outcomes with those of the control one.

attacks, rigorous analysis of standards and web applications is indispensable.
  Inspired by successful prior work, in particular the work by Akhawe et al. as

infrastructure. While unlike prior works, which aim at automatic analysis, our
model so far is not directly amenable to automation, it is much more
comprehensive and accurate with respect to the standards and specifications. As
such, it can serve as a solid basis for the analysis of a broad range of
standards and applications.
  As a case study and another important contribution of our work, we use our

Mozilla Persona), a recently developed complex real-world single sign-on system
that employs technologies such as AJAX, cross-document messaging, and HTML5 web

have been captured in prior models. We propose fixes for the flaws, formally
state relevant security properties, and prove that the fixed system in a

  Seismological Modelling","Sparse tiling is a technique to fuse loops that access common data, thus
increasing data locality. Unlike traditional loop fusion or blocking, the loops
may have different iteration spaces and access shared datasets through indirect
memory accesses, such as A[map[i]] -- hence the name ""sparse"". One notable
example of such loops arises in discontinuous-Galerkin finite element methods,
because of the computation of numerical integrals over different domains (e.g.,
cells, facets). The major challenge with sparse tiling is implementation -- not
only is it cumbersome to understand and synthesize, but it is also onerous to
maintain and generalize, as it requires a complete rewrite of the bulk of the
numerical computation. In this article, we propose an approach to extend the
applicability of sparse tiling based on raising the level of abstraction.
Through a sequence of compiler passes, the mathematical specification of a
problem is progressively lowered, and eventually sparse-tiled C for-loops are
generated. Besides automation, we advance the state-of-the-art by introducing:
a revisited, more efficient sparse tiling algorithm; support for
distributed-memory parallelism; a range of fine-grained optimizations for
increased run-time performance; implementation in a publicly-available library,
SLOPE; and an in-depth study of the performance impact in Seigen, a real-world

trend in return migration among more recent cohorts of researchers who left
Germany, which, for most disciplines, was associated with a decrease in the

  Machine Learning","We propose OmniLytics, a blockchain-based secure data trading marketplace for
machine learning applications. Utilizing OmniLytics, many distributed data
owners can contribute their private data to collectively train an ML model
requested by some model owners, and receive compensation for data contribution.
OmniLytics enables such model training while simultaneously providing 1) model
security against curious data owners; 2) data security against the curious
model and data owners; 3) resilience to malicious data owners who provide
faulty results to poison model training; and 4) resilience to malicious model
owners who intend to evade payment. OmniLytics is implemented as a blockchain
smart contract to guarantee the atomicity of payment. In OmniLytics, a model
owner splits its model into the private and public parts and publishes the
public part on the contract. Through the execution of the contract, the
participating data owners securely aggregate their locally trained models to
update the model owner's public model and receive reimbursement through the
contract. We implement a working prototype of OmniLytics on Ethereum blockchain
and perform extensive experiments to measure its gas cost, execution time, and
model quality under various parameter combinations. For training a CNN on the
MNIST dataset, the MO is able to boost its model accuracy from 62% to 83%

a wide range of specialized (co-)processors into traditional supercomputers.
Due to the efficiency of heterogeneous systems in terms of Watts and FLOPS per
surface unit, opening the access of heterogeneous platforms to a wider range of
users is an important problem to be tackled. However, heterogeneous platforms
limit the portability of the applications and increase development complexity
due to the programming skills required. Program transformation can help make
programming heterogeneous systems easier by defining a step-wise transformation
process that translates a given initial code into a semantically equivalent
final code, but adapted to a specific platform. Program transformation systems
require the definition of efficient transformation strategies to tackle the
combinatorial problem that emerges due to the large set of transformations
applicable at each step of the process. In this paper we propose a machine
learning-based approach to learn heuristics to define program transformation

reduce its input data rate of up to 25 GB/s to at most 1.25 GB/s for output
before the data is written to permanent storage. To cope with these data rates
a large PC cluster system is being designed to scale to several 1000 nodes,
connected by a fast network. For the software that will run on these nodes a
flexible data transport and distribution software framework, described in this
thesis, has been developed. The framework consists of a set of separate
components, that can be connected via a common interface. This allows to
construct different configurations for the HLT, that are even changeable at
runtime. To ensure a fault-tolerant operation of the HLT, the framework
includes a basic fail-over mechanism that allows to replace whole nodes after a
failure. The mechanism will be further expanded in the future, utilizing the
runtime reconnection feature of the framework's component interface. To connect
cluster nodes a communication class library is used that abstracts from the
actual network technology and protocol used to retain flexibility in the
hardware choice. It contains already two working prototype versions for the TCP
protocol as well as SCI network adapters. Extensions can be added to the
library without modifications to other parts of the framework. Extensive tests

  Requirements Interviews","Capturing users' engagement is crucial for gathering feedback about the
features of a software product. In a market-driven context, current approaches
to collect and analyze users' feedback are based on techniques leveraging
information extracted from product reviews and social media. These approaches
are hardly applicable in bespoke software development, or in contexts in which
one needs to gather information from specific users. In such cases, companies
need to resort to face-to-face interviews to get feedback on their products. In
this paper, we propose to utilize biometric data, in terms of physiological and
voice features, to complement interviews with information about the engagement
of the user on the discussed product-relevant topics. We evaluate our approach
by interviewing users while gathering their physiological data (i.e.,
biofeedback) using an Empatica E4 wristband, and capturing their voice through
the default audio-recorder of a common laptop. Our results show that we can
predict users' engagement by training supervised machine learning algorithms on
biometric data (F1=0.72), and that voice features alone are sufficiently
effective (F1=0.71). Our work contributes with one the first studies in
requirements engineering in which biometrics are used to identify emotions.
This is also the first study in software engineering that considers voice

one of the most time consuming steps. Although Versatile Place and Route (VPR),
which is a commonly used algorithm for this purpose, routes effectively, it is
slow in execution. One way to accelerate this design flow is to use
parallelization. Since VPR is intrinsically sequential, a set of parallel
algorithms have been recently proposed for this purpose (ParaLaR and
ParaLarPD).
  These algorithms formulate the routing process as a Linear Program (LP) and
solve it using the Lagrange relaxation, the sub-gradient method, and the
Steiner tree algorithm. Out of the many metrics available to check the
effectiveness of routing, ParaLarPD, which is an improved version of ParaLaR,
suffers from large violations in the constraints of the LP problem (which is
related to the minimum channel width metric) as well as an easily measurable
critical path delay metric that can be improved further.
  In this paper, we introduce a set of novel Lagrange heuristics that improve
the Lagrange relaxation process. When tested on the MCNC benchmark circuits, on
an average, this leads to halving of the constraints violation, up to 10%
improvement in the minimum channel width, and up to 8% reduction in the
critical path delay as obtained from ParaLarPD. We term our new algorithm as
ParaLarH. Due to the increased work in the Lagrange relaxation process, as

2D images of 3D neurons (e.g. camera lucida images and other types of 2D
microscopy). Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to
characterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The
proposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following
even in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed
in order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as
well as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for
each subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of
branches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction
to proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to
yield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported
system was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results
from a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a
different class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a
total of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these
overlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images
with close parallel segments. The proposed method is robust and may be

reasons about DA within belief evolution, and as such can better accommodate

perceptual aliasing, the posterior belief becomes a mixture of probability
distribution functions, and design cost functions that measure the expected
level of ambiguity and posterior uncertainty. Using these and standard costs
(e.g.~control penalty, distance to goal) within the objective function, yields

challenge faced by testers lies in crafting efficient test suites, able to
detect a maximum number of bugs with manageable effort. To do so, they rely on
coverage criteria, which define some precise test objectives to be covered.
However, many common criteria specify a significant number of objectives that
occur to be infeasible or redundant in practice, like covering dead code or
semantically equal mutants. Such objectives are well-known to be harmful to the
design of test suites, impacting both the efficiency and precision of testers'
effort. This work introduces a sound and scalable formal technique able to
prune out a significant part of the infeasible and redundant objectives
produced by a large panel of white-box criteria. In a nutshell, we reduce this
challenging problem to proving the validity of logical assertions in the code

weakest-precondition calculus and SMT solving for proving the assertions. The

capacity for learning non-linear functions, and bidirectional processing, which
exploits acausal information in a sequence. In this work, we explore the
delayed-RNN, which is a single-layer RNN that has a delay between the input and
output. We prove that a weight-constrained version of the delayed-RNN is
equivalent to a stacked-RNN. We also show that the delay gives rise to partial
acausality, much like bidirectional networks. Synthetic experiments confirm
that the delayed-RNN can mimic bidirectional networks, solving some acausal
tasks similarly, and outperforming them in others. Moreover, we show similar
performance to bidirectional networks in a real-world natural language

linear codes with dual distance $d$, the covering radius $R$ is at most
$\frac{n}{2}-(\frac{1}{2}-o(1))\sqrt{dn}$ and typically at least
$\frac{n}{2}-\Theta(\sqrt{dn\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$. The gap between those bounds
on $R -\frac{n}{2}$ is an $\Theta(\sqrt{\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$ factor related to
the gap between the worst covering radius given $d$ and the sphere-covering
bound. Our focus in this paper is on the case when $d = o(n)$, i.e., when the
code size is subexponential and the gap is $w(1)$. We show that up to a
constant, the gap can be eliminated by relaxing the covering requirement to
allow for missing $o(1)$ fraction of points. Namely, if the dual distance $d =
o(n)$, then for sufficiently large $d$, almost all points can be covered with
radius $R\leq\frac{n}{2}-\Theta(\sqrt{dn\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$. Compared to
random linear codes, our bound on $R-\frac{n}{2}$ is asymptotically tight up to
a factor less than $3$. We give applications to dual BCH codes. The proof
builds on the author's previous work on the weight distribution of cosets of

inverse graphics approaches to 3D understanding to be utilized in modern

based on the barycentric interpolation paradigm introduced by Floater and
Gotsman, which is in turn based on Floater's asymmetric extension of Tutte's
classical spring-embedding theorem. First, we give a much simpler algorithm to
construct piecewise-linear morphs between planar straight-line graphs.
Specifically, given isomorphic straight-line drawings $\Gamma_0$ and $\Gamma_1$
of the same 3-connected planar graph $G$, with the same convex outer face, we
construct a morph from $\Gamma_0$ to $\Gamma_1$ that consists of $O(n)$
unidirectional morphing steps, in $O(n^{1+\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm
entirely avoids the classical edge-collapsing strategy dating back to Cairns;
instead, in each morphing step, we interpolate the pair of weights associated
with a single edge. Second, we describe a natural extension of barycentric
interpolation to geodesic graphs on the flat torus. Barycentric interpolation
cannot be applied directly in this setting, because the linear systems defining
intermediate vertex positions are not necessarily solvable. We describe a
simple scaling strategy that circumvents this issue. Computing the appropriate
scaling requires $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time, after which we can can compute the
drawing at any point in the morph in $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm is

email detection methods exist, each of which employs a different algorithm to
detect undesired spam emails. But these models are vulnerable to attacks. Many
attackers exploit the model by polluting the data, which are trained to the
model in various ways. So to act deftly in such situations model needs to
readily unlearn the polluted data without the need for retraining. Retraining
is impractical in most cases as there is already a massive amount of data
trained to the model in the past, which needs to be trained again just for
removing a small amount of polluted data, which is often significantly less
than 1%. This problem can be solved by developing unlearning frameworks for all
spam detection models. In this research, unlearning module is integrated into
spam detection models that are based on Naive Bayes, Decision trees, and Random
Forests algorithms. To assess the benefits of unlearning over retraining, three
spam detection models are polluted and exploited by taking attackers' positions
and proving models' vulnerability. Reduction in accuracy and true positive
rates are shown in each case showing the effect of pollution on models. Then
unlearning modules are integrated into the models, and polluted data is
unlearned; on testing the models after unlearning, restoration of performance

Previous work in DF WLAN localization focused on the tracking of a single
entity due to the intractability of the multi-entity tracking problem whose
complexity grows exponentially with the number of humans being tracked. In this
paper, we introduce Spot as an accurate and efficient system for multi-entity
DF detection and tracking. Spot is based on a probabilistic energy minimization
framework that combines a conditional random field with a Markov model to
capture the temporal and spatial relations between the entities' poses. A novel
cross-calibration technique is introduced to reduce the calibration overhead of
multiple entities to linear, regardless of the number of humans being tracked.
This also helps in increasing the system accuracy. We design the energy
minimization function with the goal of being efficiently solved in mind. We
show that the designed function can be mapped to a binary graph-cut problem
whose solution has a linear complexity on average and a third order polynomial
in the worst case. We further employ clustering on the estimated location
candidates to reduce outliers and obtain more accurate tracking. Experimental
evaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the
state-of-the-art, shows that Spot can achieve a multi-entity tracking accuracy
of less than 1.1m. This corresponds to at least 36% enhancement in median
distance error over the state-of-the-art DF localization systems, which can
only track a single entity. In addition, Spot can estimate the number of

shown to condition word duration (Seyfarth, 2014). All else being equal, words
that tend to occur in more predictable environments are shorter than words that

informativity effect on duration is that the acoustic details of probabilistic
reduction are stored as part of a word's mental representation. Other research
has argued that predictability effects are tied to prosodic structure in
integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for
informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two
directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language,
Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional
acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence.
The acoustic information of content words was extracted from a large telephone
conversation speech corpus with over 400,000 tokens and 6,000 word types spoken
by 1,655 individuals and analyzed for the effect of informativity using
frequency statistics estimated from a 431 million word subtitle corpus. Results
indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating
the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects
on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic
prominence. Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that
predictability is closely linked to prosodic prominence, and that the lexical

  wireless networks under the $2$-hop interference model","A general open problem in networking is: what are the fundamental limits to
the performance that is achievable with some given amount of resources? More
specifically, if each node in the network has information about only its
$1$-hop neighborhood, then what are the limits to performance? This problem is
considered for wireless networks where each communication link has a minimum
bandwidth quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Links in the same vicinity
contend for the shared wireless medium. The conflict graph captures which pairs
of links interfere with each other and depends on the MAC protocol. In IEEE
802.11 MAC protocol-based networks, when communication between nodes $i$ and
$j$ takes place, the neighbors of both $i$ and $j$ remain silent. This model of
interference is called the $2$-hop interference model because the distance in
the network graph between any two links that can be simultaneously active is at
least $2$. In the admission control problem, the objective is to determine,
using only localized information, whether a given set of flow rates is
feasible.
  In the present work, a distributed algorithm is proposed for this problem,
where each node has information only about its $1$-hop neighborhood. The
worst-case performance of the distributed algorithm, i.e. the largest factor by
which the performance of this distributed algorithm is away from that of an
optimal, centralized algorithm, is analyzed. Lower and upper bounds on the
suboptimality of the distributed algorithm are obtained, and both bounds are
shown to be tight. The exact worst-case performance is obtained for some ring
topologies. While distance-$d$ distributed algorithms have been analyzed for

(based on L_1), and a detailed formal development of T_1 is given.

tautologies that have uniform polysize Frege proofs, T_1 is shown to prove the
soundness of a particular Frege system F, and F is shown to provably p-simulate
any proof system whose soundness can be proved in T_1. Finally, T_1 is compared

quantifier-free theory formalizing ALOGTIME reasoning in which a direct proof
of the soundness of some Frege system has been given (in the case of
first-order theories, such a proof was first given by Arai for his theory AID).

Gateway Protocol (BGP) is, which is used to exchange routing information
between Autonomous Systems (ASes). As proved by recent research contributions,
even S-BGP, the secure variant of BGP that is being deployed, is not fully able

study how difficult it is for a malicious AS to devise a strategy for hijacking

assumptions, in polynomial time for the type of attacks that are usually
performed in BGP, it is NP-hard for S-BGP. Our study has several by-products.

helps fixed-point computation. Inspired by this open problem and recent

  Is a fixed-point or an equilibrium fundamentally harder to find than a local
optimum? In this paper, we give a nearly-tight bound of Omega(n)^{d-1} on the

fragments of fixed size. Each peptide fragment was then described by geometric
invariants (GIs) and subjected to clustering process where the fragments
corresponding to actual linker come up as outliers. We then discover the actual
linkers by finding the longest continuous stretch of outlier fragments from
LPRs. This method was evaluated on a benchmark dataset of 51 continuous
multi-domain proteins, where it achieves F1 score of 0.745 (0.83 precision and

statements, geometric constructions are, in some provers, used to conduct the
proof, used as counter-examples to close some branches of the automatic proof.
Synthetic geometry proofs are done using geometric properties, proofs that can
have a visual counterpart in the supporting geometric construction.
  With the growing use of geometry automatic deduction tools as applications in
other areas, e.g. in education, the need to evaluate them, using different
criteria, is felt. Establishing a ranking among geometric automated theorem
provers will be useful for the improvement of the current
methods/implementations. Improvements could concern wider scope, better

bipartization (Odd Cycle Transversal), motivated by recent advances in
near-term quantum computing hardware and the related embedding problems. We
assemble a preprocessing suite of fast input reduction routines from the Odd

implementations using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems from
the quantum literature. We also generate a corpus of frustrated cluster loop
graphs, which have previously been used to benchmark quantum annealing
hardware. The diversity of these graphs leads to harder OCT instances than in
existing benchmarks.
  In addition to combinatorial branching algorithms for solving OCT directly,
we study various reformulations into other NP-hard problems such as VC and
Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling the use of solvers such as CPLEX. We
find that for heuristic solutions with time constraints under a second,
iterative compression routines jump-started with a heuristic solution perform
best, after which point using a highly tuned solver like CPLEX is worthwhile.
Results on exact solvers are split between using ILP formulations on CPLEX and
solving VC formulations with a branch-and-reduce solver. We extend our results

to generalize to other domain data. In total, over 8000 graph instances are

  a Real-World Case Study","We study an urban bike lane planning problem based on the fine-grained bike
trajectory data, which is made available by smart city infrastructure such as
bike-sharing systems. The key decision is where to build bike lanes in the
existing road network. As bike-sharing systems become widespread in the
metropolitan areas over the world, bike lanes are being planned and constructed
by many municipal governments to promote cycling and protect cyclists.
Traditional bike lane planning approaches often rely on surveys and heuristics.
We develop a general and novel optimization framework to guide the bike lane
planning from bike trajectories. We formalize the bike lane planning problem in
view of the cyclists' utility functions and derive an integer optimization
model to maximize the utility. To capture cyclists' route choices, we develop a
bilevel program based on the Multinomial Logit model. We derive structural
properties about the base model and prove that the Lagrangian dual of the bike
lane planning model is polynomial-time solvable. Furthermore, we reformulate
the route choice based planning model as a mixed integer linear program using a
linear approximation scheme. We develop tractable formulations and efficient
algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problem. Via a real-world case
study with a city government, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
algorithms and quantify the trade-off between the coverage of bike trips and
continuity of bike lanes. We show how the network topology evolves according to

function subject to a knapsack constraint, which is also known as the Budgeted
Submodular Maximization (BSM) problem. Sviridenko (2004) showed that by
guessing 3 appropriate elements of an optimal solution, and then executing a
greedy algorithm, one can obtain the optimal approximation ratio of $\alpha
=1-1/e\approx 0.632$ for BSM. However, the need to guess (by enumeration) 3
elements makes the algorithm of Sviridenko impractical as it leads to a time
complexity of $O(n^5)$ (which can be slightly improved using the thresholding
technique of Badanidiyuru & Vondrak (2014), but only to roughly $O(n^4)$). Our
main results in this paper show that fewer guesses suffice. Specifically, by
making only 2 guesses, we get the same optimal approximation ratio of $\alpha$
with an improved time complexity of roughly $O(n^3)$. Furthermore, by making
only a single guess, we get an almost as good approximation ratio of
$0.6174>0.9767\alpha$ in roughly $O(n^2)$ time.
  Prior to our work, the only algorithms that were known to obtain an
approximation ratio close to $\alpha$ for BSM were the algorithm of Sviridenko
and an algorithm of Ene & Nguyen (2019) that achieves
$(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation. However, the algorithm of Ene & Nguyen
requires ${(1/\epsilon)}^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}n\log^2 n$ time, and hence, is of
theoretical interest only as ${(1/\epsilon)}^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}$ is huge even
for moderate values of $\epsilon$. In contrast, all the algorithms we analyze
are simple and parallelizable, which makes them good candidates for practical
use.
  Recently, Tang et al. (2020) studied a simple greedy algorithm that already

  Systematic Survey of Surveys on Methods and Concepts","In the meantime, a wide variety of terminologies, motivations, approaches,
and evaluation criteria have been developed within the research field of
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). With the amount of XAI methods
vastly growing, a taxonomy of methods is needed by researchers as well as
practitioners: To grasp the breadth of the topic, compare methods, and to
select the right XAI method based on traits required by a specific use-case
context. Many taxonomies for XAI methods of varying level of detail and depth
can be found in the literature. While they often have a different focus, they
also exhibit many points of overlap. This paper unifies these efforts and
provides a complete taxonomy of XAI methods with respect to notions present in
the current state of research. In a structured literature analysis and
meta-study, we identified and reviewed more than 50 of the most cited and
current surveys on XAI methods, metrics, and method traits. After summarizing
them in a survey of surveys, we merge terminologies and concepts of the
articles into a unified structured taxonomy. Single concepts therein are
illustrated by more than 50 diverse selected example methods in total, which we
categorize accordingly. The taxonomy may serve both beginners, researchers, and
practitioners as a reference and wide-ranging overview of XAI method traits and
aspects. Hence, it provides foundations for targeted, use-case-oriented, and

without any direct experience (zero-shot), based on its relationship to
previous tasks. Humans can exhibit this cognitive flexibility. By contrast,
models that achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks often fail to
adapt to even slight task alterations. To address this, we propose a general
computational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship
to prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt
to new tasks, we propose meta-mappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic
task representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across
a wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to
image classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human
adaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these
domains, meta-mapping is successful, often achieving 80-90% performance,
without any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts
prior experience. We further show that meta-mapping can not only generalize to
new tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel
relationships unseen during training. Finally, using meta-mapping as a starting
point can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task, and reduce
learning time and cumulative error substantially. Our results provide insight

the enforcement mechanisms included in the AIA in terminology borrowed from

achievable with BLE and audio measurements, becomes predictable. Our analysis

(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online
analytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data
streams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,
and accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is
recognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing
continuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to
relational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query
specification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with
higher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across
temporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow
accessible analytics over data streams having properties from different
disciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)
dimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)
framework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with
temporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and
persistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution
over online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to
mitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in
accessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and

conventional geometric algorithms, has been seriously challenged in recent
years, since digital computers do not exhibit such capability.
  A geometric predicate usually consists of evaluating the sign of some
algebraic expression. In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable
result, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate
the algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if
the exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some
(small) varepsilon, which represents the largest error that may arise in the
evaluation of the expression. The threshold varepsilon depends on the structure
of the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the
input operands are error-free.
  A pair (arithmetic engine,threshold) is an ""arithmetic filter"". In this paper
we develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic
filter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the
probability of failure of the filter.
  To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be
chosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze
the two important predicates ""which-side"" and ""insphere"". We show that the
probability that the absolute values of the corresponding determinants be no
larger than some positive value V, with emphasis on small V, is Theta(V) for
the which-side predicate, while for the insphere predicate it is Theta(V^(2/3))

  implications for expressing projective families of distributions","Probabilistic logic programming is a major part of statistical relational
artificial intelligence, where approaches from logic and probability are
brought together to reason about and learn from relational domains in a setting
of uncertainty. However, the behaviour of statistical relational
representations across variable domain sizes is complex, and scaling inference
and learning to large domains remains a significant challenge. In recent years,
connections have emerged between domain size dependence, lifted inference and
learning from sampled subpopulations. The asymptotic behaviour of statistical
relational representations has come under scrutiny, and projectivity was
investigated as the strongest form of domain-size dependence, in which query
marginals are completely independent of the domain size.
  In this contribution we show that every probabilistic logic program under the
distribution semantics is asymptotically equivalent to an acyclic probabilistic
logic program consisting only of determinate clauses over probabilistic facts.
We conclude that every probabilistic logic program inducing a projective family
of distributions is in fact everywhere equivalent to a program from this
fragment, and we investigate the consequences for the projective families of
distributions expressible by probabilistic logic programs.
  To facilitate the application of classical results from finite model theory,
we introduce the abstract distribution semantics, defined as an arbitrary
logical theory over probabilistic facts. This bridges the gap to the
distribution semantics underlying probabilistic logic programming. In this
representation, determinate logic programs correspond to quantifier-free
theories, making asymptotic quantifier elimination results available for the
setting of probabilistic logic programming.

or fuzziness makes it difficult for users of static network visualizations to
estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or
clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots
(NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network
realizations sampled from a network distribution defined by probabilistic
edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic
and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability for uncertainty
estimation. We present a community matching algorithm to enable visualizing the
uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the
results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set
of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network
structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants' estimates fell,
on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can
be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple
properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared to articulate the
distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could
manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these

of finite monoids or finite semigroups. Usually these algebraic descriptions
yield decidability of the question whether a given regular language is
definable in a particular fragment. An effective algebraic characterization can

given fragment satisfies some identity of omega-terms, one can use
Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on word instances of the omega-terms. The resulting

omega-terms. To this end we assign a labeled linear order to every omega-term.
Our main theorem shows that a given fragment satisfies some identity of
omega-terms if and only if Duplicator has a winning strategy for the game on
the resulting linear orders. This allows to avoid the book-keeping. As an

divided into three types: character-level, word-level, and topic-level
attributes. Second, unsupervised approaches are employed to extract the
corresponding three types of text attribute features, and user relationships
are embedded as a complimentary feature. All the resultant features are
combined to form the final representation of each user. Finally, target social

theoretical foundation for extensions of logic programming languages, it can
also be viewed as a very general language to specify a wide range of
infinite-state concurrent systems.
  Our approach is based on the relation between backward reachability and
provability highlighted in our previous work on propositional LO programs.
Following this line of research, we define here a general framework for the
bottom-up evaluation of first order linear logic specifications. The evaluation
procedure is based on an effective fixpoint operator working on a symbolic
representation of infinite collections of first order linear logic formulas.

and a host graph G on n vertices, does G contain a subgraph that is isomorphic
to H? Eppstein [SODA 95, J'GAA 99] gives the first linear time algorithm for
subgraph isomorphism for a fixed-size pattern, say of order k, and arbitrary
planar host graph, improving upon the O(n^\sqrt{k})-time algorithm when using
the ``Color-coding'' technique of Alon et al [J'ACM 95]. Eppstein's algorithm
runs in time k^O(k) n, that is, the dependency on k is superexponential. We
solve an open problem posed in Eppstein's paper and improve the running time to
2^O(k) n, that is, single exponential in k while keeping the term in n linear.
Next to deciding subgraph isomorphism, we can construct a solution and
enumerate all solutions in the same asymptotic running time. We may list w
subgraphs with an additive term O(w k) in the running time of our algorithm. We
introduce the technique of ""embedded dynamic programming"" on a suitably
structured graph decomposition, which exploits the topology of the underlying
embeddings of the subgraph pattern (rather than of the host graph). To achieve
our results, we give an upper bound on the number of partial solutions in each

too has their computational cost. There are many effective techniques for
reducing a network's computational footprint (quantisation, pruning, knowledge
distillation), but these lead to models whose computational cost is the same
regardless of their input. Our human reaction times vary with the complexity of
the tasks we perform: easier tasks (e.g. telling apart dogs from boat) are
executed much faster than harder ones (e.g. telling apart two similar looking
breeds of dogs). Driven by this observation, we develop a method for adaptive
network complexity by attaching a small classification layer, which we call
SideNet, to a large pretrained network, which we call MainNet. Given an input,
the SideNet returns a classification if its confidence level, obtained via
softmax, surpasses a user determined threshold, and only passes it along to the
large MainNet for further processing if its confidence is too low. This allows
us to flexibly trade off the network's performance with its computational cost.
Experimental results show that simple single hidden layer perceptron SideNets
added onto pretrained ResNet and BERT MainNets allow for substantial decreases
in compute with minimal drops in performance on image and text classification
tasks. We also highlight three other desirable properties of our method, namely
that the classifications obtained by SideNets are calibrated, complementary to

foreground object segmentation in unconstrained videos. Unlike conventional
methods encoding motion and appearance patterns individually, our method puts
particular emphasis on their mutual assistance. Specifically, we propose using
an interactively constrained encoding (ICE) scheme to incorporate motion and
appearance patterns into a graph that leads to a spatiotemporal energy
optimization. The reason of utilizing ICE is that both motion and appearance
cues for the same target share underlying correlative structure, thus can be
exploited in a deeply collaborative manner. We perform ICE not only in the
initialization but also in the refinement stage of a two-layer framework for
object segmentation. This scheme allows our method to consistently capture
structural patterns about object perceptions throughout the whole framework.
Our method can be operated on superpixels instead of raw pixels to reduce the

pushdown system to precisely model dynamically dispatched interprocedural and
exception-driven control-flow; (2) it uses Entry-Point Saturation (EPS) to
soundly approximate all possible interleavings of asynchronous entry points in
Android applications. (It also integrates static taint-flow analysis and least

catch.) Anadroid provides rich user interface support for human analysts which

  discontinuity in viscoelastic liquids","Bubbles rising in viscoelastic liquids may exhibit a jump discontinuity of
the rise velocity as a critical bubble volume is exceeded. The phenomenon has
been extensively investigated in the literature, both by means of experiments
as well as via numerical simulations. The occurrence of the velocity jump has
been associated with a change of the bubble shape under the formation of a
pointed tip at the rear end and to the appearance of a so-called negative wake
with the liquid velocity behind the bubble, pointing in the opposite direction
to that in viscous Newtonian fluids. We revisit this topic, starting with a
review of the state of knowledge on the interrelations between the mentioned
characteristic features. In search for a convincing explanation of the jump
phenomenon, we performed detailed numerical simulations of the transient rise
of single bubbles in 3D, allowing for a local polymer molecular conformation
tensor analysis. The latter shows that polymer molecules traveling along the
upper bubble hemisphere are stretched in the circumferential direction, due to
the flow kinematics. Then, depending on the relaxation time scale of the
polymer, the stored elastic energy is either unloaded essentially above or
below the bubble's equator. In the former case, this slows down the bubble,
while the bubble gets accelerated otherwise. In this latter case, the relative
velocity of the polymer molecules against the bubble is increased, giving rise
to a self-amplification of the effect and thus causing the bubble rise velocity
to jump to a higher level. Detailed experimental velocity measurements in the
liquid field around the bubble confirmed the conclusion that the ratio of the
time scale of the Lagrangian transport of polymer molecules along the bubble
contour to the relaxation time scale of the polymer molecules determines the
sub- or supercritical state of the bubble motion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

necessarily revealed by the players about their respective inputs in a
two-party communication protocol for a variant of the Index function, namely
Augmented Index. The information cost trade-off is obtained by a novel
application of the conceptually simple and familiar ideas such as average
encoding and the cut-and-paste property of randomized protocols.
  Motivated by recent examples of exponential savings in space by streaming
quantum algorithms, we also study quantum protocols for Augmented Index.
Defining an appropriate notion of information cost for quantum protocols
involves a delicate balancing act between its applicability and the ease with
which we can analyze it. We define a notion of quantum information cost which
reflects some of the non-intuitive properties of quantum information and give a
trade-off for this notion. While this trade-off demonstrates the strength of
our proof techniques, it does not lead to a space lower bound for checking
parentheses. We leave such an implication for quantum streaming algorithms as

The approach relies on the use of the Fourier Continuation (FC) method for
spectral representation of non-periodic functions in conjunction with smooth
localized artificial viscosity assignments produced by means of a
Shock-Detecting Neural Network (SDNN). Like previous shock capturing schemes
and artificial viscosity techniques, the combined FC-SDNN strategy effectively
controls spurious oscillations in the proximity of discontinuities. Thanks to
its use of a localized but smooth artificial viscosity term, whose support is
restricted to a vicinity of flow-discontinuity points, the algorithm enjoys
spectral accuracy and low dissipation away from flow discontinuities, and, in
such regions, it produces smooth numerical solutions -- as evidenced by an
essential absence of spurious oscillations in level set lines. The FC-SDNN
viscosity assignment, which does not require use of problem-dependent
algorithmic parameters, induces a significantly lower overall dissipation than
other methods, including the Fourier-spectral versions of the previous entropy

recursion is enabled by Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem. This thesis is

by Nielsen, Plotkin and Winskel, they are used to establish a bridge between
the theory of domains and the approach to concurrency proposed by Petri. A
basic role is played by an unfolding construction that maps (safe) Petri nets
into a subclass of event structures, called prime event structures, where each
event has a uniquely determined set of causes. Prime event structures, in turn,
can be identified with their domain of configurations. At a categorical level,
this is nicely formalised by Winskel as a chain of coreflections.
  Contrary to prime event structures, general event structures allow for the
presence of disjunctive causes, i.e., events can be enabled by distinct minimal
sets of events. In this paper, we extend the connection between Petri nets and
event structures in order to include disjunctive causes. In particular, we show
that, at the level of nets, disjunctive causes are well accounted for by
persistent places. These are places where tokens, once generated, can be used
several times without being consumed and where multiple tokens are interpreted
collectively, i.e., their histories are inessential. Generalising the work on

frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In
this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic
programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the
rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches
that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the
latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties
for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.
  We address this shortcoming of existing approaches by introducing partial
meet and ensconcement constructions for logic program belief change, which
allow us to define syntax-preserving operators that satisfy preservation and
support. Our work is novel in that our constructions not only preserve more
information from a logic program during a change operation than existing ones,
but they also facilitate natural definitions of contraction operators, the
first in the field to the best of our knowledge.
  In order to evaluate the rationality of our operators, we translate the
revision and contraction postulates from the AGM and belief base frameworks to
the logic programming setting. We show that our operators fully comply with the
belief base framework and formally state the interdefinability between our
operators. We further propose an algorithm that is based on modularising a
logic program to reduce partial meet and ensconcement revisions or contractions
to performing the operation only on the relevant modules of that program.

measuring semantic similarity. LRA measures similarity in the semantic
relations between two pairs of words. When two pairs have a high degree of
relational similarity, they are analogous. For example, the pair cat:meow is
analogous to the pair dog:bark. There is evidence from cognitive science that
relational similarity is fundamental to many cognitive and linguistic tasks
(e.g., analogical reasoning). In the Vector Space Model (VSM) approach to
measuring relational similarity, the similarity between two pairs is calculated
by the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs.
The elements in the vectors are based on the frequencies of manually
constructed patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three
ways: (1) patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) Singular
Value Decomposition is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) synonyms are
used to reformulate word pairs. This paper describes the LRA algorithm and
experimentally compares LRA to VSM on two tasks, answering college-level
multiple-choice word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in
noun-modifier expressions. LRA achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching

  Distributions","We study termination of higher-order probabilistic functional programs with
recursion, stochastic conditioning and sampling from continuous distributions.
  Reasoning about the termination probability of programs with continuous
distributions is hard, because the enumeration of terminating executions cannot
provide any non-trivial bounds. We present a new operational semantics based on
traces of intervals, which is sound and complete with respect to the standard
sampling-based semantics, in which (countable) enumeration can provide
arbitrarily tight lower bounds. Consequently we obtain the first proof that
deciding almost-sure termination (AST) for programs with continuous
distributions is $\Pi^0_2$-complete. We also provide a compositional
representation of our semantics in terms of an intersection type system.
  In the second part, we present a method of proving AST for non-affine
programs, i.e., recursive programs that can, during the evaluation of the
recursive body, make multiple recursive calls (of a first-order function) from
distinct call sites. Unlike in a deterministic language, the number of
recursion call sites has direct consequences on the termination probability.
Our framework supports a proof system that can verify AST for programs that are
well beyond the scope of existing methods.

anticipate scenarios in which some conflicting policy updates must be rejected,
we enable the composition via a natural \emph{transactional} interface with

nondeterministic in the sense that the selection of program clauses is not

For some applications this nondeterminism is convenient. In some cases,
however, a deterministic metainterpreter, having an explicit selection of

  Deterministic metainterpreters are difficult to write because the programmer
must be concerned about the set of unifiers of the children of a node in the
derivation tree. We argue that it is both possible and advantageous to write
these metainterpreters by reasoning in terms of object programs converted into
a syntactically restricted form that we call ""chain"" form, where we can forget
about unification, except for unit clauses. We give two transformations

certificates signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs). However, software
products do not trust the same CAs and therefore maintain different root
stores, each typically containing hundreds of trusted roots capable of issuing

motivated Google to implement and enforce Certificate Transparency (CT). CT
logs archive certificates in a public, auditable and append-only manner. The
adoption of CT changed the trust landscape. As a part of this change, CT logs
started to maintain their own root lists and log certificates that chain back
to one of the trusted roots. In this paper, we present the first
characterization of this emerging CT root store landscape, as well as the tool
that we developed for data collection, visualization, and analysis of the root
stores. We compare the logs' root stores and quantify their changes with
respect to both each other and the root stores of major software vendors, look
at evolving vendor CT policies, and show that root store mismanagement may be
linked to log misbehavior. Finally, we present and discuss the results of a

intensifies the need of an automatic instance matching technique. However, the
efficiency of instance matching is often influenced by the weight of a property
associated to instances. Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial, however
an important task in instance matching technique. Therefore, identifying an
appropriate metric for generating weight for a property automatically is
nevertheless a formidable task. In this paper, we investigate an approach of
generating weights automatically by considering hypotheses: (1) the weight of a
property is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its distinct
values to the number of instances contain the property, and (2) the weight is
also proportional to the ratio of the number of distinct values of a property
to the number of instances in a training dataset. The basic intuition behind
the use of our approach is the classical theory of information content that
infrequent words are more informative than frequent ones. Our mathematical
model derives a metric for generating property weights automatically, which is

star operation P*Q, obtained by restricting the first argument to be a sum of
atomic actions. It generalizes prefix iteration, in which the first argument is
a single action. Complete finite equational axiomatizations are given for five
notions of bisimulation congruence over basic CCS with flat iteration, viz.
strong congruence, branching congruence, eta-congruence, delay congruence and
weak congruence. Such axiomatizations were already known for prefix iteration
and are known not to exist for general iteration. The use of flat iteration has
two main advantages over prefix iteration: 1.The current axiomatizations
generalize to full CCS, whereas the prefix iteration approach does not allow an
elimination theorem for an asynchronous parallel composition operator. 2.The
greater expressiveness of flat iteration allows for much shorter completeness
proofs.
  In the setting of prefix iteration, the most convenient way to obtain the
completeness theorems for eta-, delay, and weak congruence was by reduction to
the completeness theorem for branching congruence. In the case of weak
congruence this turned out to be much simpler than the only direct proof found.
In the setting of flat iteration on the other hand, the completeness theorems
for delay and weak (but not eta-) congruence can equally well be obtained by
reduction to the one for strong congruence, without using branching congruence
as an intermediate step. Moreover, the completeness results for prefix

and intimate partner violence, are associated with serious adverse health
outcomes for parents and children. To appropriately intervene, healthcare
professionals must first identify those at risk, yet stigma often prevents
people from directly disclosing the information needed to prompt an assessment.
We examine indirect methods of eliciting and analyzing information that could

thematic patterns, extracted by topic modeling, and emotional perspective,
drawn from dictionary-informed sentiment features. Using these features, we use
regularized regression to predict screening measures of depression and
psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Journal text entries
quantified through topic models and sentiment features show promise for
depression prediction, with performance almost as good as closed-form
questions. Text-based features were less useful for prediction of intimate

for detection without explicit disclosure. Both methods may serve as an initial

""Interpolated Factored Green Function"" (IFGF) method introduced recently for
the accelerated evaluation of discrete integral operators arising in wave
scattering and other areas (Bauinger and Bruno, Jour. Computat. Phys., 2021).
On the basis of the hierarchical IFGF interpolation strategy, the proposed
(hybrid MPI-OpenMP) parallel implementation results in highly efficient data
communication, and it exhibits in practice excellent parallel scaling up to
large numbers of cores - without any hard limitations on the number of cores
concurrently employed with high efficiency. Moreover, on any given number of
cores, the proposed parallel approach preserves the O(N log N) computing cost
inherent in the sequential version of the IFGF algorithm. Unlike other
approaches, the IFGF method does not utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),
and it is thus better suited than other methods for efficient parallelization
in distributed-memory computer systems. In particular, the IFGF method relies
on a ""peer-to-peer"" strategy wherein, at every level, field propagation is
directly enacted via ""exchanges"" between ""peer"" polynomials of low and constant
degree, without data accumulation in large-scale ""telephone-central""
mathematical constructs such as those in the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) or
pure FFT-based approaches. A variety of numerical results presented in this

of the early universe and precise estimation of cosmological constants. Due to
the contamination of thermal dust noise in the galaxy, the CMB map that is an
image on the two-dimensional sphere has missing observations, mainly
concentrated on the equatorial region. The noise of the CMB map has a
significant impact on the estimation precision for cosmological parameters.
Inpainting the CMB map can effectively reduce the uncertainty of parametric
estimation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based variational
autoencoder --- CosmoVAE, to restoring the missing observations of the CMB map.
The input and output of CosmoVAE are square images. To generate training,
validation, and test data sets, we segment the full-sky CMB map into many small
images by Cartesian projection. CosmoVAE assigns physical quantities to the
parameters of the VAE network by using the angular power spectrum of the
Gaussian random field as latent variables. CosmoVAE adopts a new loss function
to improve the learning performance of the model, which consists of $\ell_1$
reconstruction loss, Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior
distribution of encoder network and the prior distribution of latent variables,
perceptual loss, and total-variation regularizer. The proposed model achieves

rotations in a three-dimensional space and demonstrates a set of algorithms for

three-dimensional vector. The vector is parallel to the axis of rotation and
its three components transform covariantly on change of coordinates. The
mapping from rotations to vectors is 1:1 apart from computation error. The
discontinuities of the representation require special handling but are not
problematic. The rotation matrix can be generated efficiently from the vector
without the use of transcendental functions, and vice-versa. The representation
is more efficient than Euler angles, has affinities with Hassenpflug's Argyris
angles and is very closely related to the quaternion representation. While the
quaternion representation avoids the discontinuities inherent in any
3-component representation, this problem is readily overcome. The present paper
gives efficient algorithms for computing the set of rotations which map a given

growth of healthcare virtual communities of practice (VCoPs) through a
seven-year longitudinal study conducted using metrics from social-network and
semantic analysis. By studying online communication along the three dimensions
of social interactions (connectivity, interactivity and language use), the
authors aim to provide VCoP managers with valuable insights to improve the
success of their communities. Design/methodology/approach: Communications over
a period of seven years (April 2008 to April 2015) and between 14,000 members
of 16 different healthcare VCoPs coexisting on the same web platform were
analysed. Multilevel regression models were used to reveal the main
determinants of community growth over time. Independent variables were derived
from social network and semantic analysis measures. Findings: Results show that
structural and content-based variables predict the growth of the community.
Progressively, more people will join a community if its structure is more
centralised, leaders are more dynamic (they rotate more) and the language used
in the posts is less complex. Research limitations/implications: The available
data set included one Web platform and a limited number of control variables.
To consolidate the findings of the present study, the experiment should be
replicated on other healthcare VCoPs. Originality/value: The study provides
useful recommendations for setting up and nurturing the growth of professional
communities, considering, at the same time, the interaction patterns among the
community members, the dynamic evolution of these interactions and the use of
language. New analytical tools are presented, together with the use of
innovative interaction metrics, that can significantly influence community

services such as Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, and Twitter. Most applications use
CF to recommend a small set of items to the user. For instance, YouTube
presents to a user a list of top-n videos she would likely watch next based on
her rating and viewing history. Current methods of CF evaluation have been
focused on assessing the quality of a predicted rating or the ranking
performance for top-n recommended items. However, restricting the recommender
system evaluation to these two aspects is rather limiting and neglects other
dimensions that could better characterize a well-perceived recommendation. In
this paper, instead of optimizing rating or top-n recommendation, we focus on
the task of predicting which items generate the highest user engagement. In
particular, we use Twitter as our testbed and cast the problem as a
Collaborative Ranking task where the rich features extracted from the metadata
of the tweets help to complement the transaction information limited to user
ids, item ids, ratings and timestamps. We learn a scoring function that
directly optimizes the user engagement in terms of nDCG@10 on the predicted

processes have a location and are sensible to actions of dynamic update at

concurrent processes. We introduce a core calculus of adaptable processes and
propose two verification problems for them: bounded and eventual adaptation.
While the former ensures that the number of consecutive erroneous states that
can be traversed during a computation is bound by some given number k, the
latter ensures that if the system enters into a state with errors then a state
without errors will be eventually reached. We study the (un)decidability of
these two problems in several variants of the calculus, which result from

for global continuous optimization with a limited budget of black-box function

previous evaluations and an infill criterion - the expected improvement - used
to find a promising point for a new evaluation. The `expected improvement'
infill criterion takes into account the mean and variance of a predictive
multivariate Gaussian distribution.
  The expected improvement algorithm has recently been generalized to
multiobjective optimization. In order to measure the improvement of a Pareto
front quantitatively the gain in dominated (hyper-)volume is used. The
computation of the expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) is a
multidimensional integration of a step-wise defined non-linear function related
to the Gaussian probability density function over an intersection of boxes.
This paper provides a new algorithm for the exact computation of the expected
improvement to more than two objective functions. For the bicriteria case it
has a time complexity in $O(n^2)$ with $n$ denoting the number of points in the
current best Pareto front approximation. It improves previously known
algorithms with time complexity $O(n^3 \log n)$. For tricriteria optimization
we devise an algorithm with time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Besides discussing the
new time complexity bounds the speed of the new algorithm is also tested

the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted message. However, this approach
poses privacy concerns. Especially with popular cloud services, the control
over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not

necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers,

the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a
special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any
third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance.

Thus, a stable-matching Voronoi diagram is a solution to the well-known post

a limit on the size of its jurisdiction. Previous work on the stable-matching
Voronoi diagram provided existence and uniqueness proofs, but did not analyze

stable-matching Voronoi diagram of $n$ point sites has $O(n^{2+\varepsilon})$
faces and edges, for any $\varepsilon>0$, and show that this bound is almost
tight by giving a family of diagrams with $\Theta(n^2)$ faces and edges. We

Despite many pigeonhole principle-based solutions proposed in the last few
decades, the condition stated by the principle is weak. It only constrains the
number of items in a single box. By organizing the boxes in a ring, we propose
a new principle, called the pigeonring principle, which constrains the number

  Transformers in Machine Learning Pipeline","In recent years, many incidents have been reported where machine learning
models exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.
Research has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine
learning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build
a pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed
by a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a
single classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the
preprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed
that often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather
than the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness
caused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In
this paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the
fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged
existing metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we
conducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37
pipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain
data transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a
number of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.
Finally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in
the global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose
appropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine
learning pipeline.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

in many flavours, ranging from fine-grained comparisons such as ready
simulation to coarse-grained ones such as trace inclusion. Often, such
behavioural preorders are characterized in terms of theory inclusion in
dedicated characteristic logics; e.g. simulation is characterized by theory
inclusion in the positive fragment of Hennessy-Milner logic. We introduce a
unified semantic framework for behavioural preorders and their characteristic
logics in which we parametrize the system type as a functor on the category
$\mathsf{Pos}$ of partially ordered sets following the paradigm of universal
coalgebra, while behavioural preorders are captured as graded monads on
$\mathsf{Pos}$, in generalization of a previous approach to notions of process
equivalence. We show that graded monads on $\mathsf{Pos}$ are induced by a form
of graded inequational theories that we introduce here. Moreover, we provide a
general notion of modal logic compatible with a given graded behavioural
preorder, along with a criterion for expressiveness, in the indicated sense of
characterization of the behavioural preorder by theory inclusion. We illustrate

define a Cook-Reckhow (i.e., polynomially verifiable) algebraic analog of Frege
proofs, different from that given in [BIKPRS96,GH03]. We then turn to an
apparently weaker system, namely, polynomial calculus (PC) where polynomials
are written as ordered formulas (PC over ordered formulas, for short): an
ordered polynomial is a noncommutative polynomial in which the order of
products in every monomial respects a fixed linear order on variables; an
algebraic formula is ordered if the polynomial computed by each of its
subformulas is ordered. We show that PC over ordered formulas is strictly
stronger than resolution, polynomial calculus and polynomial calculus with
resolution (PCR) and admits polynomial-size refutations for the pigeonhole
principle and the Tseitin's formulas. We conclude by proposing an approach for
establishing lower bounds on PC over ordered formulas proofs, and related

COVID-19. Echo chambers promote conspiracy theories about the virus and are
found to be linked to vaccine hesitancy, less compliance with mask mandates,
and the practice of social distancing. Moreover, the problem of echo chambers
is connected to other pertinent issues like political polarization and the
spread of misinformation. An echo chamber is defined as a network of users in
which users only interact with opinions that support their pre-existing beliefs
and opinions, and they exclude and discredit other viewpoints. This survey aims
to examine the echo chamber phenomenon on social media from a social computing
perspective and provide a blueprint for possible solutions. We survey the
related literature to understand the attributes of echo chambers and how they
affect the individual and society at large. Additionally, we show the
mechanisms, both algorithmic and psychological, that lead to the formation of
echo chambers. These mechanisms could be manifested in two forms: (1) the bias
of social media's recommender systems and (2) internal biases such as
confirmation bias and homophily. While it is immensely challenging to mitigate
internal biases, there has been great efforts seeking to mitigate the bias of
recommender systems. These recommender systems take advantage of our own biases

values and detect column corruptions, existing robust Matrix Completion (MC)
methods mostly concentrate on recovering a low-rank matrix from few corrupted

samples are both as high as $O(\min\{m,n\}/\log^3 (m+n))$. Our model covers
previous ones as special cases, and robust MC can recover the intrinsic matrix
with a higher rank. Moreover, we suggest a universal choice of the
regularization parameter, which is $\lambda=1/\sqrt{\log n}$. By our
$\ell_{2,1}$ filtering algorithm, which has theoretical guarantees, we can
further reduce the computational cost of our model. As an application, we also

indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free

their generalizations imply lower bounds of $\sqrt{t}$, or stronger, for many
infinite metric spaces such as the unit interval. Is this dichotomy universal?
We prove that the answer is yes: for every metric space, the optimal regret of
a Lipschitz MAB algorithm is either bounded above by any $f\in \omega(\log t)$,
or bounded below by any $g\in o(\sqrt{t})$. Perhaps surprisingly, this
dichotomy does not coincide with the distinction between finite and infinite
metric spaces; instead it depends on whether the completion of the metric space
is compact and countable. Our proof connects upper and lower bound techniques

operation $\boxtimes$ and a target graph property ${\cal P}$. Typically, the
modification operation $\boxtimes$ may be vertex removal}, edge removal}, edge
contraction}, or edge addition and the question is, given a graph $G$ and an
integer $k$, whether it is possible to transform $G$ to a graph in ${\cal P}$
after applying $k$ times the operation $\boxtimes$ on $G$. This problem has
been extensively studied for particilar instantiations of $\boxtimes$ and
${\cal P}$. In this paper we consider the general property ${\cal P}_{{\phi}}$
of being planar and, moreover, being a model of some First-Order Logic sentence
${\phi}$ (an FOL-sentence). We call the corresponding meta-problem Graph
$\boxtimes$-Modification to Planarity and ${\phi}$ and prove the following
algorithmic meta-theorem: there exists a function $f:\Bbb{N}^{2}\to\Bbb{N}$
such that, for every $\boxtimes$ and every FOL sentence ${\phi}$, the Graph
$\boxtimes$-Modification to Planarity and ${\phi}$ is solvable in
$f(k,|{\phi}|)\cdot n^2$ time. The proof constitutes a hybrid of two different
classic techniques in graph algorithms. The first is the irrelevant vertex
technique that is typically used in the context of Graph Minors and deals with

given probability distribution over a finite number of items. Campbell
generalized the Huffman problem to a family of problems in which the goal is to
minimize not mean codeword length but rather a generalized mean known as a
quasiarithmetic or quasilinear mean. Such generalized means have a number of
diverse applications, including applications in queueing. Several
quasiarithmetic-mean problems have novel simple redundancy bounds in terms of a
generalized entropy. A related property involves the existence of optimal
codes: For ``well-behaved'' cost functions, optimal codes always exist for
(possibly infinite-alphabet) sources having finite generalized entropy. Solving
finite instances of such problems is done by generalizing an algorithm for
finding length-limited binary codes to a new algorithm for finding optimal
binary codes for any quasiarithmetic mean with a convex cost function. This
algorithm can be performed using quadratic time and linear space, and can be
extended to other penalty functions, some of which are solvable with similar
space and time complexity, and others of which are solvable with slightly
greater complexity. This reduces the computational complexity of a problem
involving minimum delay in a queue, allows combinations of previously
considered problems to be optimized, and greatly expands the space of problems
solvable in quadratic time and linear space. The algorithm can be extended for
purposes such as breaking ties among possibly different optimal codes, as with

  Estimation with Application to Pose Graph Optimization","Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular
measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product
with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is
non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative
solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an
approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is
based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is
equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer
vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum
likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely
unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood
solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is ""close"" to the actual
nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem
at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates,
for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that
the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., {\sigma} =
30{\deg} on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors
commonly used in mapping. For most range-finder-based scenarios, the
multi-hypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the

computability logic, it was proved earlier that the logic of interactive Turing
reduction is exactly the implicative fragment of Heyting's intuitionistic
calculus. That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational
resource represented by the antecedent. An at least equally basic and natural
sort of algorithmic reduction, however, is the one that does not allow such
reusage. The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of
reduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more
than just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization.
The first (Turing) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three
natural versions. While those three versions are very different from each
other, their logical behaviors (in isolation) turn out to be indistinguishable,
with that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative
intuitionistic logic. Among the other contributions of the present article is
an informal introduction of a series of new -- finite and bounded -- versions

first-order logic language offering both extensional and (a restricted form of)
intensional sets (RIS). RIS are introduced as first-class citizens of the

Syntactic restrictions on RIS guarantee that the denoted sets are finite,

respect to any first-order theory X providing at least equality and a decision
procedure for X-formulas. In particular, we consider the instance of L_RIS when
X is the theory of hereditarily finite sets and binary relations. We also
present a working implementation of this instance as part of the {log} tool and

programs against attacks. Fuzzing has to be effective in producing inputs that
cover functionality and find vulnerabilities. But it also has to be efficient
in producing such inputs quickly. Random fuzzers are very efficient, as they
can quickly generate random inputs; but they are not very effective, as the
large majority of inputs generated is syntactically invalid. Grammar-based
fuzzers make use of a grammar (or another model for the input language) to
produce syntactically correct inputs, and thus can quickly cover input space
and associated functionality. Existing grammar-based fuzzers are surprisingly
inefficient, though: Even the fastest grammar fuzzer Dharma still produces
inputs about a thousand times slower than the fastest random fuzzer. So far,
one can have an effective or an efficient fuzzer, but not both.
  In this paper, we describe how to build fast grammar fuzzers from the ground
up, treating the problem of fuzzing from a programming language implementation
perspective. Starting with a Python textbook approach, we adopt and adapt
optimization techniques from functional programming and virtual machine
implementation techniques together with other novel domain-specific
optimizations in a step-by-step fashion. In our F1 prototype fuzzer, these
improve production speed by a factor of 100--300 over the fastest grammar

infinite words simultaneously. The only binary relations apart from equality

characterizations of the fragments Sigma2 = Sigma2[<,+1] and FO2 = FO2[<,+1] in
terms of algebraic and topological properties. To this end we introduce the
factor topology over infinite words. It turns out that a language L is in the
intersection of FO2 and Sigma2 if and only if L is the interior of an FO2
language. Symmetrically, a language is in the intersection of FO2 and Pi2 if
and only if it is the topological closure of an FO2 language. The fragment
Delta2, which by definition is the intersection of Sigma2 and Pi2 contains
exactly the clopen languages in FO2. In particular, over infinite words Delta2
is a strict subclass of FO2. Our characterizations yield decidability of the

inconspicuous data over a public communication channel in such a way that no
one, aside from the sender and the intended receiver, can even detect the
presence of the secret message. In this paper, we provide a new
provably-secure, private-key steganographic encryption protocol secure in the
framework of Hopper et al. We first present a ""one-time stegosystem"" that
allows two parties to transmit messages of length at most that of the shared
key with information-theoretic security guarantees. The employment of a
pseudorandom generator (PRG) permits secure transmission of longer messages in
the same way that such a generator allows the use of one-time pad encryption
for messages longer than the key in symmetric encryption. The advantage of our
construction, compared to all previous work is randomness efficiency: in the
information theoretic setting our protocol embeds a message of length n bits
using a shared secret key of length (1+o(1))n bits while achieving security
2^{-n/log^{O(1)}n}; simply put this gives a rate of key over message that is 1
as n tends to infinity (the previous best result achieved a constant rate
greater than 1 regardless of the security offered). In this sense, our protocol
is the first truly randomness efficient steganographic system. Furthermore, in
our protocol, we can permit a portion of the shared secret key to be public
while retaining precisely n private key bits. In this setting, by separating
the public and the private randomness of the shared key, we achieve security of
2^{-n}. Our result comes as an effect of the application of randomness

birthmarks that the author has come across developing GUI class libraries.
C++'s view of classes, instances and hierarchies appears tantalizingly close to
GUI concepts of controls, widgets, window classes and subwindows. OO models of
C++ and of a window system are however different. C++ was designed to be a
""static"" language with a lexical name scoping, static type checking and
hierarchies defined at compile time. Screen objects on the other hand are
inherently dynamic; they usually live well beyond the procedure/block that
created them; the hierarchy of widgets is defined to a large extent by layout,
visibility and event flow. Many GUI fundamentals such as dynamic and geometric
hierarchies of windows and controls, broadcasting and percolation of events are
not supported directly by C++ syntax or execution semantics (or supported as
""exceptions"" -- pun intended). Therefore these features have to be emulated in
C++ GUI code. This leads to duplication of a graphical toolkit or a window
manager functionality, code bloat, engaging in unsafe practices and forgoing of

  pattern","BPMN is a specification language widely used by industry and researchers for
business process modeling and execution. It defines clearly how to articulate
its concepts, but do not provide mechanism to represent the semantics of the
produced models. This paper addresses the problem of how to improve the
expressiveness of BPMN models, proposing a definition for the semantics of a
business process within a BPMN model, and improving the completeness of the
models in a systematic manner, so that models can describe far more situations
with few extra managed complexity. We conceive a framework based on the
business transaction patterns available in the enterprise ontology body of
knowledge to prescribe the foundations of semantic BPMN models. A tool has been
developed to automate the framework. Then, two industrial proof-of-concepts are
used to measure its coverage, both positive and negative, and to argue about
our proposal's usefulness. After that, the proposal is compared with others
using a systematic literature review. A full BPMN pattern is proposed
encompassing the happy flow, the declinations, the rejections and the
revocations, without adding any new element to the BPMN specification. A
software tool has been developed, and made publicly available, to support the
automatic generation of the BPMN models from the proposed patterns. Our
semantified BPMN pattern allowed the identification of a large amount of
implicit, and other not implemented, situations in both proof-of-concepts. It
is concluded that the usage of a semantic solution, grounded on a sound
pattern, allows the systematic enrichment of the BPMN models with a bounded
effort. Moreover, to simplify the BPMN executable models' implementation, its
elements could be classified as implicit, explicit, or not implemented yet.

faults. Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network
can sustain so that it still contains a large (i.e. linear-sized) connected
component that still has approximately the same expansion as the original
fault-free network. For this we apply a pruning technique which culls away
parts of the faulty network which have poor expansion. This technique can be
applied to both adversarial faults and to random faults. For adversarial faults
we prove that for every network with expansion alpha, a large connected
component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for
up to a constant times alpha n faults. This result is tight in the sense that
every graph G of size n and uniform expansion alpha(.), i.e. G has an expansion
of alpha(n) and every subgraph G' of size m of G has an expansion of
O(alpha(m)), can be broken into sublinear components with omega(alpha(n) n)
faults.
  For random faults we observe that the situation is significantly different,
because in this case the expansion of a graph only gives a very weak bound on
its resilience to random faults. More specifically, there are networks of
uniform expansion O(sqrt{n}) that are resilient against a constant fault
probability but there are also networks of uniform expansion Omega(1/log n)
that are not resilient against a O(1/log n) fault probability. Thus, a
different parameter is needed. For this we introduce the span of a graph which
allows us to determine the maximum fault probability in a much better way than
the expansion can. We use the span to show the first known results for the

  Segmentation - Simple Experiments in Simple Non-Memetic Genetic Algorithms","Neoteny, also spelled Paedomorphosis, can be defined in biological terms as
the retention by an organism of juvenile or even larval traits into later life.
In some species, all morphological development is retarded; the organism is
juvenilized but sexually mature. Such shifts of reproductive capability would
appear to have adaptive significance to organisms that exhibit it. In terms of
evolutionary theory, the process of paedomorphosis suggests that larval stages
and developmental phases of existing organisms may give rise, under certain
circumstances, to wholly new organisms. Although the present work does not
pretend to model or simulate the biological details of such a concept in any
way, these ideas were incorporated by a rather simple abstract computational
strategy, in order to allow (if possible) for faster convergence into simple
non-memetic Genetic Algorithms, i.e. without using local improvement procedures
(e.g. via Baldwin or Lamarckian learning). As a case-study, the Genetic
Algorithm was used for colour image segmentation purposes by using K-mean
unsupervised clustering methods, namely for guiding the evolutionary algorithm
in his search for finding the optimal or sub-optimal data partition. Average
results suggest that the use of neotonic strategies by employing juvenile
genotypes into the later generations and the use of linear-dynamic mutation
rates instead of constant, can increase fitness values by 58% comparing to
classical Genetic Algorithms, independently from the starting population

software. More specifically, it tackles the problem of efficient computation of
channel capacity, the maximum amount of confidential information leaked by
software, measured in Shannon entropy or R\'{e}nyi's min-entropy.
  Most approaches to computing channel capacity are either efficient and return
only (possibly very loose) upper bounds, or alternatively are inefficient but
precise; few target realistic programs. In this thesis, we present a novel
approach to the problem by reducing it to a model counting problem on
first-order logic, which we name Model Counting Modulo Theories or #SMT for
brevity.
  For quantitative security, our contribution is twofold. First, on the
theoretical side we establish the connections between measuring confidentiality
leaks and fundamental verification algorithms like Symbolic Execution, SMT
solvers and DPLL. Second, exploiting these connections, we develop novel
#SMT-based techniques to compute channel capacity, which achieve both accuracy
and efficiency. These techniques are scalable to real-world programs, and
illustrative case studies include C programs from Linux kernel, a Java program
from a European project and anonymity protocols.
  For formal verification, our contribution is also twofold. First, we
introduce and study a new research problem, namely #SMT, which has other
potential applications beyond computing channel capacity, such as returning
multiple-counterexamples for Bounded Model Checking or automated test

\geq 2$ machines jointly perform computations on graphs with $n$ nodes
(typically, $n \gg k$). The input graph is assumed to be initially randomly
partitioned among the $k$ machines, a common implementation in many real-world
systems. Communication is point-to-point, and the goal is to minimize the
number of communication rounds of the computation.
  Our main result is an (almost) optimal distributed randomized algorithm for
graph connectivity. Our algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(n/k^2)$ rounds

$\poly\log(n)$ term). This improves over the best previously known bound of

polylogarithmic factor) in view of an existing lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(n/k^2)$. Our improved algorithm uses a bunch of techniques,
including linear graph sketching, that prove useful in the design of efficient

communities, leading to the design of a wide variety of solutions.
Unfortunately, this classical IM problem ignores the fact that time taken for
influence propagation to reach the largest scope can be significant in
realworld social networks, during which the underlying network itself may have
evolved. This phenomenon may have considerable adverse impact on the quality of
selected seeds and as a result all existing techniques that use this classical
definition as their building block generate seeds with suboptimal influence
spread. In this paper, we revisit the classical IM problem and propose a more
realistic version called PROTEUS-IM (Propagation Time conscious Influence
Maximization) to replace it by addressing the aforementioned limitation.
Specifically, as influence propagation may take time, we assume that the
underlying social network may evolve during influence propagation.
Consequently, PROTEUSIM aims to select seeds in the current network to maximize
influence spread in the future instance of the network at the end of influence
propagation process without assuming complete topological knowledge of the
future network. We propose a greedy and a Reverse Reachable (RR) set-based

setting, each ball also samples two random bins but can only estimate a bin's
load by sending binary queries of the form ""Is the load at least the median?""
or ""Is the load at least 100?"".
  For the lightly loaded case $m=O(n)$, Feldheim and Gurel-Gurevich (2021)
showed that with one query it is possible to achieve a maximum load of
$O(\sqrt{\log n/\log \log n})$, and posed the question whether a maximum load
of $m/n+O(\sqrt{\log n/\log \log n})$ is possible for any $m = \Omega(n)$. In
this work, we resolve this open problem by proving a lower bound of
$m/n+\Omega( \sqrt{\log n})$ for a fixed $m=\Theta(n \sqrt{\log n})$, and a
lower bound of $m/n+\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$ for some $m$ depending on the

  We complement this negative result by proving a positive result for multiple
queries. In particular, we show that with only two binary queries per chosen
bin, there is an oblivious strategy which ensures a maximum load of
$m/n+O(\sqrt{\log n})$ for any $m \geq 1$. Further, for any number of $k =
O(\log \log n)$ binary queries, the upper bound on the maximum load improves to
$m/n + O(k(\log n)^{1/k})$ for any $m \geq 1$.
  Further, this result for $k$ queries implies (i) new bounds for the
$(1+\beta)$-process introduced by Peres et al (2015), (ii) new bounds for the
graphical balanced allocation process on dense expander graphs, and (iii) the
bound of $m/n+O(\log \log n)$ on the maximum load achieved by the Two-Choice

academia for its huge potential of modeling the network traits such as
macrostructure and single node attributes. However, prior mainstream works
mainly focus on homogeneous network and lack the capacity to characterize the
network heterogeneous property. Besides, most previous literature cannot model
the influence under microscope vision, making it infeasible to model the joint
relation between the heterogeneity and mutual interaction within multiple
relation type. In this paper, we propose an Influence Self-attention network to
address the difficulties mentioned above. To model heterogeneity and mutual
interaction, we redesign attention mechanism with influence factor on the
single-type relation level, which learns the importance coefficient from its
adjacent neighbors under the same meta-path based patterns. To incorporate the
heterogeneous meta-path in a unified dimension, we developed a self-attention
based framework for meta-path relation fusion according to the learned
meta-path coefficient. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework
not only achieve higher results than current state-of-the-art baselines, but
also show promising vision on depicting heterogeneous interactive relations

after his Tesla Model X crashed into a highway barrier in Mountain View,
California. Tesla immediately disavowed responsibility for the accident. ""The
fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and
there was none here: [Mr. Huang] was well aware that the Autopilot was not
perfect [and the] only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang
was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple
warnings to do so."" This is the standard response from Tesla and Uber, the
manufacturers of the automated vehicles involved in the six fatal accidents to
date: the automated vehicle isn't perfect, the driver knew it wasn't perfect,
and if only the driver had been paying attention and heeded the vehicle's
warnings, the accident would never have occurred.
  However, as researchers focused on human-automation interaction in aviation
and military operations, we cannot help but wonder if there really are no
broken promises and no legal liabilities. Science has a critical role in
determining legal liability, and courts appropriately rely on scientists and
engineers to determine whether an accident, or harm, was foreseeable.
Specifically, a designer could be found liable if, at the time of the accident,
scientists knew there was a systematic relationship between the accident and
the designer's untaken precaution.
  Nearly 70 years of research provides an undeniable answer: It is
insufficient, inappropriate, and dangerous to automate everything you can and
leave the rest to the human. There is a systematic relationship between the

system, that uses cycles of bindings rather than the linear chains of bindings
used in the standard WAM representation. Both the HAL and dProlog languages
make use of the PARMA representation in their Herbrand constraint solvers.
Unfortunately, PARMA's trailing scheme is considerably more expensive in both
time and space consumption. The aim of this paper is to present several
techniques that lower the cost.
  First, we introduce a trailing analysis for HAL using the classic PARMA
trailing scheme that detects and eliminates unnecessary trailings. The
analysis, whose accuracy comes from HAL's determinism and mode declarations,
has been integrated in the HAL compiler and is shown to produce space
improvements as well as speed improvements. Second, we explain how to modify
the classic PARMA trailing scheme to halve its trailing cost. This technique is
illustrated and evaluated both in the context of dProlog and HAL. Finally, we
explain the modifications needed by the trailing analysis in order to be
combined with our modified PARMA trailing scheme. Empirical evidence shows that
the combination is more effective than any of the techniques when used in
isolation.

for deep reinforcement learning in micro-simulators, we train two policies, one
policy with noise injected into the state and action space and one without any
injected noise. In simulation, the autonomous vehicle learns an emergent
metering behavior for both policies in which it slows to allow for smoother
merging. We then directly transfer this policy without any tuning to the
University of Delaware Scaled Smart City (UDSSC), a 1:25 scale testbed for
connected and automated vehicles. We characterize the performance of both
policies on the scaled city. We show that the noise-free policy winds up
crashing and only occasionally metering. However, the noise-injected policy
consistently performs the metering behavior and remains collision-free,
suggesting that the noise helps with the zero-shot policy transfer.
Additionally, the transferred, noise-injected policy leads to a 5% reduction of

simulation method to remove such bias. We further demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method in the setting when the eigenvalue estimates from multiple

takes place using a domain-specific, fine-tuned transformer model. Second,
similar claims extracted from heterogeneous sources are clustered together with
related scientific literature using a method that exploits their content and
the connections among them. Third, check-worthy claims, broadcasted by popular

that are in some sense nearly-planar. Here, planarity is relaxed by allowing
edge crossings, but only with respect to some local forbidden crossing
configurations. Early research dates back to the 1960s (e.g., Avital and Hanani
1966) for extremal problems on geometric graphs, but is also related to graph
drawing problems where visual clutter by edge crossings should be minimized
(e.g., Huang et al. 2008) that could negatively affect the readability of the
drawing. Different types of forbidden crossing configurations give rise to
different families of nearly-planar graphs.
  Most of the literature focuses on Tur\'an-type problems, which ask for the
maximum number of edges a nearly-planar graph can have. Here, we study this
problem for bipartite topological graphs, considering several types of
nearly-planar graphs, i.e., 1-planar, 2-planar, fan-planar, and RAC graphs. We
prove bounds on the number of edges that are tight up to small additive
constants; some of them are surprising and not along the lines of the known
results for non-bipartite graphs. Our findings lead to an improvement of the

  Transmissions in Sensor Networks","Future Internet of Things (IoT) applications will require that billions of
wireless devices transmit data to the cloud frequently. However, the wireless
medium access is pointed as a problem for the next generations of wireless
networks; hence, the number of data transmissions in Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs) can quickly become a bottleneck, disrupting the exponential growth in
the number of interconnected devices, sensors, and amount of produced data.
Therefore, keeping a low number of data transmissions is critical to
incorporate new sensor nodes and measure a great variety of parameters in
future generations of WSNs. Thanks to the high accuracy and low complexity of
state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms, Dual Prediction Schemes (DPSs) are
potential candidates to optimize the data transmissions in WSNs at the finest
level because they facilitate for sensor nodes to avoid unnecessary
transmissions without affecting the quality of their measurements. In this
work, we present a sensor network model that uses statistical theorems to
describe the expected impact of DPSs and data aggregation in WSNs. We aim to
provide a foundation for future works by characterizing the theoretical gains
of processing data in sensors and conditioning its transmission to the
predictions' accuracy. Our simulation results show that the number of
transmissions can be reduced by almost 98% in the sensor nodes with the highest
workload. We also detail the impact of predicting and aggregating transmissions

misconceptions. Teachers frequently face the challenge of first having to
understand such bugs, and then suggest ways to fix them. In order to enable
teachers to do so effectively and efficiently, it is desirable to support them
in recognising and fixing bugs. Misconceptions often lead to recurring patterns
of similar bugs, enabling automated tools to provide this support in terms of
hints on occurrences of common bug patterns. In this paper, we investigate to
what extent the hints improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in
debugging learners' programs using a cohort of 163 primary school teachers in
training, tasked to correct buggy Scratch programs, with and without hints on
bug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints can
reduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66 to 5.24 minutes, while
increasing the effectiveness by 34% more correct solutions. While this
improvement is convincing, arguably teachers in training might first need to
learn debugging ""the hard way"" to not miss the opportunity to learn by relying
on tools. We therefore investigate whether the use of hints during training
affects their ability to recognise and fix bugs without hints. Our experiment
provides no significant evidence that either learning to debug with hints or
learning to debug ""the hard way"" leads to better learning effects. Overall,

DDI research by extracting evidence for large numbers of potential interactions

PubMed abstracts and annotated sentences to evaluate the efficacy of literature
mining on two tasks: first, identifying PubMed abstracts containing
pharmacokinetic evidence of DDIs; second, extracting sentences containing such
evidence from abstracts. We implemented a text mining pipeline and evaluated it
using several linear classifiers and a variety of feature transforms. The most
important textual features in the abstract and sentence classification tasks
were analyzed. We also investigated the performance benefits of using features

constructor terms in the right-hand sides of rules are subterms of constructor
terms in the left-hand side; the computational intuition is that rules cannot
build new data structures. It is well-known that cons-free programming
languages can be used to characterize computational complexity classes, and
that cons-free first-order term rewriting can be used to characterize the set
of polynomial-time decidable sets.
  We investigate cons-free higher-order term rewriting systems, the complexity
classes they characterize, and how these depend on the order of the types used
in the systems. We prove that, for every k $\geq$ 1, left-linear cons-free
systems with type order k characterize E$^k$TIME if arbitrary evaluation is
used (i.e., the system does not have a fixed reduction strategy).
  The main difference with prior work in implicit complexity is that (i) our
results hold for non-orthogonal term rewriting systems with possible rule
overlaps with no assumptions about reduction strategy, (ii) results for such
term rewriting systems have previously only been obtained for k = 1, and with
additional syntactic restrictions on top of cons-freeness and left-linearity.

end are programmable systems, which allow expert users (i.e. programmers) to
write software artifacts that describe complex abstractions, but programs are

to easily create varied content but present insurmountable walls when a desired
feature is not built-in. Both programmatic and direct manipulation have
distinct strengths, but users must typically choose one over the other or use
some ad-hoc combination of systems. Our goal, put simply, is to bridge this

desirable properties: for example, they are easy to understand and encourage
the candidates to choose electoral platforms that have a broad appeal. In this
paper, we investigate both classic and parameterized computational complexity
of electoral campaign management under such rules. We focus on two methods that
can be used to promote a given candidate: asking voters to move this candidate
upwards in their preference order or asking them to change the number of
candidates they approve of. We show that finding an optimal campaign management
strategy of the first type is easy for both Bucklin and Fallback. In contrast,

structure is called a default structure. We study axioms for the nonmonotonic

using skeptical reasoning, but extensions are now used for the construction of
possible worlds in a default information structure.
  In previous work we showed that skeptical reasoning arising from
default-extensions obeys a well-behaved set of axioms including the axiom of
cautious cut. We show here that, remarkably, the converse is also true: any
consequence relation obeying this set of axioms can be represented as one
constructed from skeptical reasoning. We provide representation theorems to
relate axioms for nonmonotonic consequence relation and properties about
extensions, and provide one-to-one correspondence between nonmonotonic systems
which satisfies the law of cautious monotony and default structures with unique
extensions. Our results give a theoretical justification for a set of basic
rules governing the update of nonmonotonic knowledge bases, demonstrating the
derivation of them from the more concrete and primitive construction of
extensions. It is also striking to note that proofs of the representation
theorems show that only shallow extensions are necessary, in the sense that the

three different class labels, namely, healthy lungs, ordinary pneumonia, and
covid-19 infected pneumonia, out of which 470 X-ray images belong to the
covid-19 category. Methods: We first pre-process all the images using histogram
equalization techniques and segment them using U-net architecture. VGG-16
network is then used for feature extraction from the pre-processed images which
is further sampled by SMOTE oversampling technique to achieve a balanced
dataset. Finally, the class-balanced features are classified using a support

conveying information. Similarly, realistic co-speech gestures are crucial to
enable natural and smooth interactions with social agents. Current end-to-end
co-speech gesture generation systems use a single modality for representing

either acoustically-linked beat gestures or semantically-linked gesticulation
(e.g., raising a hand when saying ""high""): they cannot appropriately learn to
generate both gesture types. We present a model designed to produce arbitrary
beat and semantic gestures together. Our deep-learning based model takes both

gestures as a sequence of joint angle rotations as output. The resulting
gestures can be applied to both virtual agents and humanoid robots. Subjective

electronic commerce and online shopping nowadays. They have multiple slots to
provide deals with significant discounts to their visitors every day. The
current user traffic allocation mostly relies on human decisions. We study the
problem of automatically allocating the user traffic of a group-buying website
to different deals to maximize the total revenue and refer to it as the
Group-buying Allocation Problem (\GAP). The key challenge of \GAP\ is how to
handle the tipping point (lower bound) and the purchase limit (upper bound) of
each deal. We formulate \GAP\ as a knapsack-like problem with variable-sized
items and majorization constraints. Our main results for \GAP\ can be
summarized as follows. (1) We first show that for a special case of \GAP, in
which the lower bound equals the upper bound for each deal, there is a simple
dynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in
pseudo-polynomial time. (2) The general case of \GAP\ is much more difficult
than the special case. To solve the problem, we first discover several
structural properties of the optimal allocation, and then design a two-layer
dynamic programming-based algorithm leveraging those properties. This algorithm
can find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial time. (3) We convert the
two-layer dynamic programming based algorithm to a fully polynomial time
approximation scheme (FPTAS), using the technique developed in

programs. Besides these results, we further investigate some natural

began slowly when the technical foundations for the World Wide Web were defined

beyond its original technical foundations and deeply affecting the world today
- and even more so the society of the future. We have seen that the Web can
influence the realization of human rights and even the pursuit of happiness.
The Web provides an infrastructure to help us to learn, to work, to communicate
with loved ones, and to provide entertainment. However, it also creates an
environment affected by the digital divide between those who have and those who
do not have access. Additionally, the Web provides challenges we must
understand if we are to find a viable balance between data ownership and
privacy protection, between over-whelming surveillance and the prevention of
terrorism. For the Web to succeed, we need to understand its societal
challenges including increased crime, the impact of social platforms and
socio-economic discrimination, and we must work towards fairness, social
inclusion, and open governance.
  Ten Yars ago, the field of Web Science was created to explore the science
underlying the Web from a socio-technical perspective including its
mathematical properties, engineering principles, and social impacts. Ten years
later, we are learning much as the interdisciplinary endeavor to understand the
Web's global information space continues to grow.

  tensors on modern multi-core CPUs","There are several factorizations of multi-dimensional tensors into
lower-dimensional components, known as `tensor networks'. We consider the
popular `tensor-train' (TT) format and ask: How efficiently can we compute a
low-rank approximation from a full tensor on current multi-core CPUs?
  Compared to sparse and dense linear algebra, kernel libraries for
multi-linear algebra are rare and typically not as well optimized. Linear
algebra libraries like BLAS and LAPACK may provide the required operations in
principle, but often at the cost of additional data movements for rearranging
memory layouts. Furthermore, these libraries are typically optimized for the
compute-bound case (e.g.\ square matrix operations) whereas low-rank tensor
decompositions lead to memory bandwidth limited operations.
  We propose a `tensor-train singular value decomposition' (TT-SVD) algorithm
based on two building blocks: a `Q-less tall-skinny QR' factorization, and a
fused tall-skinny matrix-matrix multiplication and reshape operation. We
analyze the performance of the resulting TT-SVD algorithm using the Roofline
performance model. In addition, we present performance results for different
algorithmic variants for shared-memory as well as distributed-memory
architectures. Our experiments show that commonly used TT-SVD implementations
suffer severe performance penalties. We conclude that a dedicated library for
tensor factorization kernels would benefit the community: Computing a low-rank
approximation can be as cheap as reading the data twice from main memory. As a
consequence, an implementation that achieves realistic performance will move

  NP-Completeness Proof for Three Atoms","We address a discrete tomography problem that arises in the study of the
atomic structure of crystal lattices. A polyatomic structure T can be defined
as an integer lattice in dimension D>=2, whose points may be occupied by $c$
distinct types of atoms. To ``analyze'' T, we conduct ell measurements that we
call_discrete X-rays_. A discrete X-ray in direction xi determines the number
of atoms of each type on each line parallel to xi. Given ell such non-parallel
X-rays, we wish to reconstruct T.
  The complexity of the problem for c=1 (one atom type) has been completely
determined by Gardner, Gritzmann and Prangenberg, who proved that the problem
is NP-complete for any dimension D>=2 and ell>=3 non-parallel X-rays, and that
it can be solved in polynomial time otherwise.
  The NP-completeness result above clearly extends to any c>=2, and therefore
when studying the polyatomic case we can assume that ell=2. As shown in another
article by the same authors, this problem is also NP-complete for c>=6 atoms,
even for dimension D=2 and axis-parallel X-rays. They conjecture that the
problem remains NP-complete for c=3,4,5, although, as they point out, the proof
idea does not seem to extend to c<=5.

of the dataset, we develop and contrast two deterministic packing algorithms.

therefore packing can be performed on the histogram of sequence lengths, rather
than per sample. This transformation of the problem leads to algorithms which
are fast and have linear complexity in dataset size. The shortest-pack-first

spectrogram of an audio signal with the same time-frequency resolutions, number
of filters, and dimensionality reduction scale. According to the constant-Q

high frequency bands with high time resolution filters. In the spectrogram of a

approach combines two main ingredients: (i) an entropic semidefinite
optimization based on matrix exponential learning (MXL); and (ii) a one-shot
gradient estimator which achieves low variance through the reuse of past
information. This novel algorithm, which we call gradient-free MXL algorithm

more detail, in a MIMO multiple access channel with $K$ users and $M$ transmit

within $\text{poly}(K,M)/\epsilon^2$ iterations (on average and with high
probability), even when implemented in a fully distributed, asynchronous
manner. For cross-validation, we also perform a series of numerical experiments
in medium- to large-scale MIMO networks under realistic channel conditions.
Throughout our experiments, the performance of MXL0$^{+}$ matches$-$and

networks, focusing on the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering schemes. The
main motivation is to address the yet poorly understood size variation-induced
effect on power-aware buffering schemes. Our theoretical analysis elucidates
the fundamental differences between the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering
schemes in the presence of data size variation. It shows that data size
variation has detrimental effects on the power expenditure of the fixed-size
buffering in general, and reveals that the size variation induced effects can
be either mitigated by a positive skewness or promoted by a negative skewness
in size distribution. By contrast, the fixed-interval buffering scheme has an
obvious advantage of being eminently immune to the data-size variation. Hence
the fixed-interval buffering scheme is a risk-averse strategy for its
robustness in a variety of operational environments. In addition, based on the
fixed-interval buffering scheme, we establish the power consumption
relationship between child nodes and parent node in a static data collection
tree, and give an in-depth analysis of the impact of child bandwidth
distribution on parent's power consumption.
  This study is of practical significance: it sheds new light on the

propositional logic with indexed propositions, e.g. P_i, P_i+1, P_1, and with
generalized connectives, e.g. /\i=1..n or i=1..n (called ""iterations"") where n
is an (unbound) integer variable called a ""parameter"". The expressive power of
iterated schemata is strictly greater than propositional logic: it is even out

that can prove that a schema is satisfiable for at least one value of its
parameter, in the spirit of the DPLL procedure. However the converse problem,
i.e. proving that a schema is unsatisfiable for every value of the parameter,
is undecidable so DPLL* does not terminate in general. Still, we prove that it
terminates for schemata of a syntactic subclass called ""regularly nested"". This

classical approaches are to build the string graph or the de Bruijn graph. Each
has advantages over the other depending on the application. Still, the ideal
setting would be to have an index of the reads that is easy to build and can be
adapted to any type of biological analysis. In this paper, we propose a new
data structure we call rBOSS, which gets close to that ideal. Our rBOSS is a de
Bruijn graph in practice, but it simulates any length up to k and can compute
overlaps of size at least m between the labels of the nodes, with k and m being
parameters. If we choose the parameter k equal to the size of the reads, then
we can simulate a complete string graph. As most BWT-based structures, rBOSS is
unidirectional, but it exploits the property of the DNA reverse complements to
simulate bi-directionality with some time-space trade-offs. We implemented a

each color class contains a vertex that has at least one neighbor in all the
other color classes. The b-Coloring problem asks whether a graph $G$ has a
$b$-coloring with $k$ colors. The $b$-chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted
by $\chi_b(G)$, is the maximum number $k$ such that $G$ admits a $b$-coloring
with $k$ colors. We consider the complexity of the b-Coloring problem, whenever
the value of $k$ is close to one of two upper bounds on $\chi_b(G)$: The
maximum degree $\Delta(G)$ plus one, and the $m$-degree, denoted by $m(G)$,

characteristics of real-world graphs, namely heavy-tailed degree distributions
and large clustering coefficients, imply the existence of substantially large
vertex neighborhoods with high edge-density. This observation suggests a very
simple approach for extracting large quasi-cliques: simply scan the vertex
neighborhoods, compute the clustering coefficient of each vertex, and output
the best such subgraph. The implementation of such a method requires counting
the triangles in a graph, which is a well-studied problem in graph mining. When
empirically tested across a number of real-world graphs, this approach reveals
a surprise: vertex neighborhoods include maximal cliques of non-trivial sizes,
and the density of the best neighborhood often compares favorably to subgraphs
produced by dedicated algorithms for maximizing subgraph density. For graphs
with small clustering coefficients, we demonstrate that small vertex
neighborhoods can be refined using a local-search method to ``grow'' larger
cliques and near-cliques. Our results indicate that contrary to worst-case

significantly impacted consumer confidence in this technology. The cause for
many of these accidents can be traced back to the inability of these vehicles
to correctly sense the impending danger. In response, manufacturers have been
improving the already extensive on-vehicle sensor packages to ensure that the
system always has access to the data necessary to ensure safe navigation.
However, these sensor packages only provide a view from the vehicle's
perspective and, as a result, autonomous vehicles still require frequent human
intervention to ensure safety.
  To address this issue, I developed a system, called Horus, that combines
on-vehicle and infrastructure-based sensors to provide a more complete view of
the environment, including areas not visible from the vehicle. I built a
small-scale experimental testbed as a proof of concept. My measurements of the
impact of sensor failures showed that even short outages (1 second) at slow
speeds (25 km/hr scaled velocity) prevents vehicles that rely on on-vehicle
sensors from navigating properly. My experiments also showed that Horus
dramatically improves driving safety and that the sensor fusion algorithm
selected plays a significant role in the quality of the navigation. With just a
pair of infrastructure sensors, Horus could tolerate sensors that fail 40% of
the time and still navigate safely. These results are a promising first step

logical perspective, Courcelle's theorem establishes a sufficient condition, or
an upper bound, for tractability of MSO-model checking.
  Whereas such upper bounds on the complexity of logics have received
significant attention in the literature, almost nothing is known about

the complexity of monadic second-order logic. In particular, we show that if C
is any class of graphs which is closed under taking subgraphs and whose
treewidth is not bounded by a polylogarithmic function (in fact, $\log^c n$ for
some small c suffices) then MSO-model checking is intractable on C (under a

  the Chunks and Tasks programming model","We present a method for parallel block-sparse matrix-matrix multiplication on
distributed memory clusters. By using a quadtree matrix representation, data
locality is exploited without prior information about the matrix sparsity
pattern. A distributed quadtree matrix representation is straightforward to
implement due to our recent development of the Chunks and Tasks programming
model [Parallel Comput. 40, 328 (2014)]. The quadtree representation combined
with the Chunks and Tasks model leads to favorable weak and strong scaling of
the communication cost with the number of processes, as shown both
theoretically and in numerical experiments.
  Matrices are represented by sparse quadtrees of chunk objects. The leaves in
the hierarchy are block-sparse submatrices. Sparsity is dynamically detected by
the matrix library and may occur at any level in the hierarchy and/or within
the submatrix leaves. In case graphics processing units (GPUs) are available,
both CPUs and GPUs are used for leaf-level multiplication work, thus making use
of the full computing capacity of each node.
  The performance is evaluated for matrices with different sparsity structures,
including examples from electronic structure calculations. Compared to methods
that do not exploit data locality, our locality-aware approach reduces
communication significantly, achieving essentially constant communication per

features that help users bootstrap social networks on the website by copying
links from an established network like Facebook or Twitter. This paper
quantifies the extent to which such social bootstrapping is effective in
enhancing a social experience of the website. First, we develop a stylised
analytical model that suggests that copying tends to produce a giant connected
component (i.e., a connected community) quickly and preserves properties such
as reciprocity and clustering, up to a linear multiplicative factor. Second, we
use data from two websites, Pinterest and Last.fm, to empirically compare the
subgraph of links copied from Facebook to links created natively. We find that
the copied subgraph has a giant component, higher reciprocity and clustering,
and confirm that the copied connections see higher social interactions.
However, the need for copying diminishes as users become more active and
influential. Such users tend to create links natively on the website, to users

the delay between a workload shift and the associated change. A better approach
is to generate small changes that tune the physical design over time, forecast
the utility of these changes, and apply them ahead of time to maximize their

  This paper presents predictive indexing that continuously improves a
database's physical design using lightweight physical design changes. It uses a
machine learning model to forecast the utility of these changes, and
continuously refines the index configuration of the database to handle evolving
workloads. We introduce a lightweight hybrid scan operator with which a DBMS
can make use of partially-built indexes for query processing. Our evaluation

competitive performance in medical image analysis tasks, such as disease
classification, tumor segmentation, and lesion detection. CNN has great
advantages in extracting local features of images. However, due to the locality

Recently, transformers have been applied to computer vision and achieved
remarkable success in large-scale datasets. Compared with natural images,
multi-modal medical images have explicit and important long-range dependencies,
and effective multi-modal fusion strategies can greatly improve the performance
of deep models. This prompts us to study transformer-based structures and apply
them to multi-modal medical images. Existing transformer-based network
architectures require large-scale datasets to achieve better performance.
However, medical imaging datasets are relatively small, which makes it
difficult to apply pure transformers to medical image analysis. Therefore, we
propose TransMed for multi-modal medical image classification. TransMed
combines the advantages of CNN and transformer to efficiently extract low-level
features of images and establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We

(CS) and a head-mounted display (HMD). Using three visual conditions
(audio-only, virtual characters and video recordings), three groups of
participants were tested: seventeen young normal-hearing, eleven older
normal-hearing, and ten older hearing-impaired listeners. Results: When there
were no visual cues, participants tended to look ahead; when visual information
was available, they looked at the target talker. Participants generally turned
their head close towards the target talkers when presented as video than
virtual characters. In addition, an effect of display showed that in the most
extreme case when the talker was at 45 degrees, they turned closer when wearing
the HMD than when viewing the curved screen. Open interviews showed that the CS
was preferred over the HMD for older participants and that video recordings
were the preferred visual condition. Conclusions: Using different audiovisual
setups may lead to slightly different movement behavior in terms of head yaw
and horizontal gaze. These differences, as well as preference for specific
audiovisual technologies, should be taken into account when designing and
comparing experiments.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

shifted away from the user by providing a library of exact analysis in which
the computer handles the error estimates. Previously, we [Krebbers/Spitters
2011] provided a fast implementation of the exact real numbers in the Coq proof
assistant. Our implementation improved on an earlier implementation by O'Connor
by using type classes to describe an abstract specification of the underlying
dense set from which the real numbers are built. In particular, we used dyadic
rationals built from Coq's machine integers to obtain a 100 times speed up of
the basic operations already. This article is a substantially expanded version
of [Krebbers/Spitters 2011] in which the implementation is extended in the
various ways. First, we implement and verify the sine and cosine function.
Secondly, we create an additional implementation of the dense set based on
Coq's fast rational numbers. Thirdly, we extend the hierarchy to capture order
on undecidable structures, while it was limited to decidable structures before.
This hierarchy, based on type classes, allows us to share theory on the

  Decoding","This paper analyzes the distribution of cycle lengths in turbo decoding and
low-density parity check (LDPC) graphs. The properties of such cycles are of
significant interest in the context of iterative decoding algorithms which are
based on belief propagation or message passing. We estimate the probability
that there exist no simple cycles of length less than or equal to k at a
randomly chosen node in a turbo decoding graph using a combination of counting
arguments and independence assumptions. For large block lengths n, this
probability is approximately e^{-{2^{k-1}-4}/n}, k>=4. Simulation results
validate the accuracy of the various approximations. For example, for turbo
codes with a block length of 64000, a randomly chosen node has a less than 1%
chance of being on a cycle of length less than or equal to 10, but has a
greater than 99.9% chance of being on a cycle of length less than or equal to
20. The effect of the ""S-random"" permutation is also analyzed and it is shown
that while it eliminates short cycles of length k<8, it does not significantly
affect the overall distribution of cycle lengths. Similar analyses and
simulations are also presented for graphs for LDPC codes. The paper concludes

constitutes a strong boundary expander with almost full GF(2)-linear rank, a
property which also enables us to prove a 2^{\Omega(n)} lower bound for the
expected number of steps required by the focused random walk heuristic to solve
typical instances drawn from the ensemble. These results paint a grim picture

general one-point AG codes, without any assumption. We also extend their unique
decoding algorithm to list decoding, modify it so that it can be used with the
Feng-Rao improved code construction, prove equality between its error
correcting capability and half the minimum distance lower bound by Andersen and
Geil (2008) that has not been done in the original proposal except for
one-point Hermitian codes, remove the unnecessary computational steps so that
it can run faster, and analyze its computational complexity in terms of
multiplications and divisions in the finite field. As a unique decoding
algorithm, the proposed one is empirically and theoretically as fast as the BMS
algorithm for one-point Hermitian codes. As a list decoding algorithm,
extensive experiments suggest that it can be much faster for many moderate
size/usual inputs than the algorithm by Beelen and Brander (2010). It should be
noted that as a list decoding algorithm the proposed method seems to have
exponential worst-case computational complexity while the previous proposals

project. ESCAPE stands for Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather
Prediction at Exascale. The project develops world-class, extreme-scale
computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather prediction

which are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit
of the Berkeley dwarfs). These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware
architectures (single and multi-node) and alternative algorithms are explored.
Performance portability is addressed through the use of domain specific
languages.
  In today's computer architectures, moving data is considerably more time- and
energy consuming than computing on this data. One of the key performance
optimizations for any application is therefore to minimize data motion and
maximize data reuse. Especially on modern supercomputers with very complex and
deep memory hierarchies, it is mandatory to take data locality into account.
Especially when targeting accelerators with directive systems like OpenACC or
OpenMP, identifying data scope, access type and data reuse are critical to
minimize the data transfers from and to the accelerator. Unfortunately,
manually identifying data locality information in complex code bases can be a
time consuming task and tool support is therefore desirable.
  In this report we summarize the results of a survey of currently available
tools that support software developers and performance engineers with data

as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory

collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician's diagnosis.
The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting
trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or
pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),
reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by
the physicians' diagnosis. In order to classify subject's respiratory pathology
condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The
resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory
pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate
among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of
pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider
the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to
have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is
above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing

  Interaction in VR","Mid-air interaction is one of the promising interaction modalities in virtual

interaction suffers from the lack of haptic feedback as no force or
vibrotactile feedback can be provided in mid-air. As a breakthrough to
compensate for this insufficiency, the application of pseudo-haptic features
which create the visuo-haptic illusion without actual physical haptic stimulus
can be explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of four
pseudo-haptic features: proximity feedback, protrusion, hit effect, and
penetration blocking on user experience for free-hand mid-air button
interaction in VR. We conducted a user study on 21 young subjects to collect
user ratings on various aspects of user experience while users were freely
interacting with 16 buttons with different combinations of four features.
Results indicated that all investigated features significantly improved user
experience in terms of haptic illusion, embodiment, sense of reality,
spatiotemporal perception, satisfaction, and hedonic quality. In addition,
protrusion and hit effect were more beneficial in comparison with the other two
features. It is recommended to utilize the four proposed pseudo-haptic features
in 3D user interfaces (UIs) to make users feel more pleased and amused, but

an adversary may choose as they adapt their strategy dynamically to sustain

approaching these types of applications, in particular in the context of
Anti-Money Laundering. We provide a mechanism through which diverse, realistic

adversarial actions to enable organizations to preemptively mitigate these

enriched relational representation to represent observed human behavior. (b) A
modelling approach that observes these traces and is able to accurately infer
the goals of actors by classifying the behavior into money laundering or
standard behavior despite significant unobserved activity. And (c) a synthetic
behavior simulator that can generate new previously unseen traces. The
simulator incorporates a high level of flexibility in the behavioral parameters

names representing these objects. These are more expressive than infinite
sequences, which served as names in prior work that formulated complexity in
more restricted settings. An advantage of using string functions is that we can
define their ""size"" in the way inspired by higher-type complexity theory. This
enables us to talk about computation on string functions whose time or space is
bounded polynomially in the input size, giving rise to more general analogues
of the classes P, NP, and PSPACE. We also define NP- and PSPACE-completeness
under suitable many-one reductions.
  Because our framework separates machine computation and semantics, it can be
applied to problems on sets of interest in analysis once we specify a suitable
representation (encoding). As prototype applications, we consider the
complexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real
functions. For example, the task of numerical algorithms for solving a certain
class of differential equations is naturally viewed as an operator taking real
functions to real functions. As there was no complexity theory for operators,
previous results only stated how complex the solution can be. We now
reformulate them and show that the operator itself is polynomial-space

  Maps","Self-Organizing Map algorithms have been used for almost 40 years across
various application domains such as biology, geology, healthcare, industry and
humanities as an interpretable tool to explore, cluster and visualize
high-dimensional data sets. In every application, practitioners need to know
whether they can \textit{trust} the resulting mapping, and perform model
selection to tune algorithm parameters (e.g. the map size). Quantitative
evaluation of self-organizing maps (SOM) is a subset of clustering validation,
which is a challenging problem as such. Clustering model selection is typically
achieved by using clustering validity indices. While they also apply to
self-organized clustering models, they ignore the topology of the map, only
answering the question: do the SOM code vectors approximate well the data
distribution? Evaluating SOM models brings in the additional challenge of
assessing their topology: does the mapping preserve neighborhood relationships
between the map and the original data? The problem of assessing the performance
of SOM models has already been tackled quite thoroughly in literature, giving
birth to a family of quality indices incorporating neighborhood constraints,
called \textit{topographic} indices. Commonly used examples of such metrics are
the topographic error, neighborhood preservation or the topographic product.
However, open-source implementations are almost impossible to find. This is the
issue we try to solve in this work: after a survey of existing SOM performance

satisfiability can be decided. This result is established in two ways: firstly,
by an effective equivalence-preserving translation into the BSR fragment, and,
secondly, by a model-theoretic argument.

other decidable classes of first-order sentences. The paper presents a second
fragment which is novel, has a decidable satisfiability problem, and properly
contains the Ackermann fragment and---once more---the relational monadic
fragment. The definition is again characterized by restrictions on the
occurrences of variables in atoms. More precisely, after certain
transformations, Skolemization yields only unary functions and constants, and

  Multiobjective Optimisation of Cost and Shield-Value","The general problem in this paper is vertex (node) subset selection with the
goal to contain an infection that spreads in a network. Instead of selecting
the single most important node, this paper deals with the problem of selecting
multiple nodes for removal. As compared to previous work on multiple-node
selection, the trade-off between cost and benefit is considered. The benefit is
measured in terms of increasing the epidemic threshold which is a measure of
how difficult it is for an infection to spread in a network. The cost is
measured in terms of the number and size of nodes to be removed or controlled.
Already in its single-objective instance with a fixed number of $k$ nodes to be
removed, the multiple vertex immunisation problems have been proven to be
NP-hard. Several heuristics have been developed to approximate the problem. In
this work, we compare meta-heuristic techniques with exact methods on the
Shield-value, which is a sub-modular proxy for the maximal eigenvalue and used
in the current state-of-the-art greedy node-removal strategies. We generalise
it to the multi-objective case and replace the greedy algorithm by a quadratic
program (QP), which then can be solved with exact QP solvers. The main
contribution of this paper is the insight that, if time permits, exact and
problem-specific methods approximation should be used, which are often far
better than Pareto front approximations obtained by general meta-heuristics.
Based on these, it will be more effective to develop strategies for controlling
real-world networks when the goal is to prevent or contain epidemic outbreaks.

  Regulators and Nonideal Clocks","Flow reshaping is used in time-sensitive networks (as in the context of IEEE
TSN and IETF Detnet) in order to reduce burstiness inside the network and to
support the computation of guaranteed latency bounds. This is performed using
per-flow regulators (such as the Token Bucket Filter) or interleaved regulators
(as with IEEE TSN Asynchronous Traffic Shaping). Both types of regulators are
beneficial as they cancel the increase of burstiness due to multiplexing inside
the network. It was demonstrated, by using network calculus, that they do not
increase the worst-case latency. However, the properties of regulators were
established assuming that time is perfect in all network nodes. In reality,
nodes use local, imperfect clocks. Time-sensitive networks exist in two
flavours: (1) in non-synchronized networks, local clocks run independently at
every node and their deviations are not controlled and (2) in synchronized
networks, the deviations of local clocks are kept within very small bounds
using for example a synchronization protocol (such as PTP) or a satellite based
geo-positioning system (such as GPS). We revisit the properties of regulators
in both cases. In non-synchronized networks, we show that ignoring the timing
inaccuracies can lead to network instability due to unbounded delay in per-flow
or interleaved regulators. We propose and analyze two methods (rate and burst
cascade, and asynchronous dual arrival-curve method) for avoiding this problem.
In synchronized networks, we show that there is no instability with per-flow
regulators but, surprisingly, interleaved regulators can lead to instability.
To establish these results, we develop a new framework that captures industrial
requirements on clocks in both non-synchronized and synchronized networks, and

potential attackers as a Stackelberg game in which the auditor chooses an
auditing policy and attackers choose which records to target. A corresponding

http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01585v1,Finite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes with State Constraints,"Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been used to formulate many
decision-making problems in science and engineering. The objective is to
synthesize the best decision (action selection) policies to maximize expected
rewards (minimize costs) in a given stochastic dynamical environment. In many
practical scenarios (multi-agent systems, telecommunication, queuing, etc.),
the decision-making problem can have state constraints that must be satisfied,
which leads to Constrained MDP (CMDP) problems. In the presence of such state
constraints, the optimal policies can be very hard to characterize. This paper
introduces a new approach for finding non-stationary randomized policies for
finite-horizon CMDPs. An efficient algorithm based on Linear Programming (LP)
and duality theory is proposed, which gives the convex set of feasible policies
and ensures that the expected total reward is above a computable lower-bound.
The resulting decision policy is a randomized policy, which is the projection
of the unconstrained deterministic MDP policy on this convex set. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first result in state constrained MDPs to give an
efficient algorithm for generating finite horizon randomized policies for CMDP
with optimality guarantees. A simulation example of a swarm of autonomous
agents running MDPs is also presented to demonstrate the proposed CMDP solution

  and approximability","In the stable marriage and roommates problems, a set of agents is given, each
of them having a strictly ordered preference list over some or all of the other
agents. A matching is a set of disjoint pairs of mutually accepted agents. If
any two agents mutually prefer each other to their partner, then they block the
matching, otherwise, the matching is said to be stable. In this paper we
investigate the complexity of finding a solution satisfying additional
constraints on restricted pairs of agents. Restricted pairs can be either
forced or forbidden. A stable solution must contain all of the forced pairs,
while it must contain none of the forbidden pairs.
  Dias et al. gave a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether such a
solution exists in the presence of restricted edges. If the answer is no, one
might look for a solution close to optimal. Since optimality in this context
means that the matching is stable and satisfies all constraints on restricted
pairs, there are two ways of relaxing the constraints by permitting a solution
to: (1) be blocked by some pairs (as few as possible), or (2) violate some
constraints on restricted pairs (again as few as possible).

case (1) leads to NP-hardness and inapproximability results, whilst case (2)

required to execute the instruction on the network. The cost of gas is adjusted
using transaction fees to ensure adequate payment of the network. In this work,
we highlight the ""real"" economics of smart contracts. We show that the actual
costs of executing smart contracts are disproportionate to the computational
costs and that this gap is continuously widening. We show that the gas
cost-model of the underlying EVM instruction-set is wrongly modeled.
Specifically, the computational cost for the SLOAD instruction increases with
the length of the blockchain. Our proposed performance model estimates gas
usage and execution time of a smart contract at a given block-height. The new
gas-cost model incorporates the block-height to eliminate irregularities in the
Ethereum gas calculations. Our findings are based on extensive experiments over

http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0306131v1,Complexity of Cycle Length Modularity Problems in Graphs,"The even cycle problem for both undirected and directed graphs has been the
topic of intense research in the last decade. In this paper, we study the
computational complexity of \emph{cycle length modularity problems}. Roughly
speaking, in a cycle length modularity problem, given an input (undirected or
directed) graph, one has to determine whether the graph has a cycle $C$ of a
specific length (or one of several different lengths), modulo a fixed integer.
We denote the two families (one for undirected graphs and one for directed
graphs) of problems by $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ and $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$,
where $m \in \mathcal{N}$ and $S \subseteq \{0,1, ..., m-1\}$.
$(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ (respectively, $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$) is defined as
follows: Given an undirected (respectively, directed) graph $G$, is there a
cycle in $G$ whose length, modulo $m$, is a member of $S$? In this paper, we
fully classify (i.e., as either polynomial-time solvable or as ${\rm
NP}$-complete) each problem $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ such that $0 \in S$ and
each problem $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$ such that $0 \notin S$. We also give a

search on a metric space is related to the expansion of the metric space. Given
a metric space we look at the graph obtained by connecting every pair of points
within a certain distance $r$ . We then look at various notions of expansion in
this graph relating them to the cell probe complexity of NNS for randomized and
deterministic, exact and approximate algorithms. For example if the graph has
node expansion $\Phi$ then we show that any deterministic $t$-probe data
structure for $n$ points must use space $S$ where $(St/n)^t > \Phi$. We show
similar results for randomized algorithms as well. These relationships can be
used to derive most of the known lower bounds in the well known metric spaces
such as $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_\infty$ by simply computing their expansion. In the
process, we strengthen and generalize our previous results (FOCS 2008).
Additionally, we unify the approach in that work and the communication
complexity based approach. Our work reduces the problem of proving cell probe
lower bounds of near neighbor search to computing the appropriate expansion
parameter. In our results, as in all previous results, the dependence on $t$ is
weak; that is, the bound drops exponentially in $t$. We show a much stronger

transitions and identify the threshold points exactly. By encoding CSPs into
CNF formulas, it is proved that almost all instances of Model RB/RD have no

introduce new families of CNF formulas hard for resolution, which is a central
task of Proof-Complexity theory, but also propose models with both many hard

are addressed. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that an
application of Model RB/RD might be in the generation of hard satisfiable
instances, which is not only of practical importance but also related to some
open problems in cryptography such as generating one-way functions.
Subsequently, a further theoretical support for the generation method is shown
by establishing exponential lower bounds on the complexity of solving random
satisfiable and forced satisfiable instances of RB/RD near the threshold.

information retrieval community. This paper proposes a Japanese/English CLIR
system, where we combine a query translation and retrieval modules. We
currently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore the
performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation
of technical terms. However, the technical term translation is still
problematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new
terms are progressively created by combining existing base words. In addition,
Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient
coverage. To counter the first problem, we produce a Japanese/English
dictionary for base words, and translate compound words on a word-by-word
basis. We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambiguity. For
the second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words
unlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the

the modal mu-calculus for this problem. First, we analyze the periodic
behaviour of CTL over OCPs and derive a model checking algorithm whose running
time is exponential only in the number of control locations and a syntactic
notion of the formula that we call leftward until depth. Thus, model checking
fixed OCPs against CTL formulas with a fixed leftward until depth is in P. This
generalizes a result of the first author, Mayr, and To for the expression
complexity of CTL's fragment EF. Second, we prove that already over some fixed
OCP, CTL model checking is PSPACE-hard. Third, we show that there already
exists a fixed CTL formula for which model checking of OCPs is PSPACE-hard. To
obtain the latter result, we employ two results from complexity theory: (i)
Converting a natural number in Chinese remainder presentation into binary

finite-volume/finite-difference scheme for the viscous and resistive equations
of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) based on an appropriate 3-split of the governing
PDE system, which is decomposed into a first convective subsystem, a second
subsystem involving the coupling of the velocity field with the magnetic field
and a third subsystem involving the pressure-velocity coupling. The nonlinear
convective terms are discretized explicitly, while the remaining two subsystems
accounting for the Alfven waves and the magneto-acoustic waves are treated
implicitly. The final algorithm is at least formally constrained only by a mild
CFL stability condition depending on the velocity field of the pure
hydrodynamic convection. To preserve the divergence-free constraint of the
magnetic field exactly at the discrete level, a proper set of overlapping dual
meshes is employed. The resulting linear algebraic systems are shown to be
symmetric and therefore can be solved by means of an efficient standard
matrix-free conjugate gradient algorithm. One of the peculiarities of the
presented algorithm is that the magnetic field is defined on the edges of the
main grid, while the electric field is on the faces. The final scheme can be
regarded as a novel shock-capturing, conservative and structure preserving
semi-implicit scheme for the nonlinear viscous and resistive MHD equations.

them; this is known as multitask learning. As a special case, we can use
multiple responses to better identify shared predictive features -- a project
we might call multitask feature selection.

for regression, focusing on ell_0 regularization methods and their
interpretation within a Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework. Section 2
proposes a novel extension of MDL feature selection to the multitask setting.
The approach, called the ""Multiple Inclusion Criterion"" (MIC), is designed to
borrow information across regression tasks by more easily selecting features
that are associated with multiple responses. We show in experiments on
synthetic and real biological data sets that MIC can reduce prediction error in
settings where features are at least partially shared across responses. Section
3 surveys hypothesis testing by regression with a single response, focusing on
the parallel between the standard Bonferroni correction and an MDL approach.
Mirroring the ideas in Section 2, Section 4 proposes a novel MIC approach to
hypothesis testing with multiple responses and shows that on synthetic data

bioBERT, sciBERT). We find that the improved training data leads to a large
improvement in the quality of the trained models. In addition, the BERT models
beat CRF and Flair, with recall scores around 97% obtained with cross
validation. With the best model we label a large collection of 33 thousand
patents, extract the citations, and match them to publications in the Web of

range of the generated perturbations in each warm restart, which can obtain
better attack effect. Experiments on two public datasets show that the

temporally uncontrolled, being influenced by factors such as - human aspects,
subjective behavior, the context of interaction, the inherent speed-accuracy
trade-off where, emphasizing accuracy compromises speed of interaction and vice

adjustment for compensating accuracy. However, no significant adjustment exists
in the literature for compensating speed in different contexts of interaction

The ability to represent large sets of possible instances (worlds) while
supporting efficient storage and processing is an important challenge in this
context. The recent formalism of world-set decompositions (WSDs) provides a
space-efficient representation for uncertain data that also supports scalable
processing. WSDs are complete for finite world-sets in that they can represent
any finite set of possible worlds. For possibly infinite world-sets, we show
that a natural generalization of WSDs precisely captures the expressive power
of c-tables. We then show that several important decision problems are

  Tool for Singers","Current computational-emotion research has focused on applying acoustic
properties to analyze how emotions are perceived mathematically or used in
natural language processing machine learning models. While recent interest has
focused on analyzing emotions from the spoken voice, little experimentation has
been performed to discover how emotions are recognized in the singing voice --
both in noiseless and noisy data (i.e., data that is either inaccurate,
difficult to interpret, has corrupted/distorted/nonsense information like
actual noise sounds in this case, or has a low ratio of usable/unusable
information). Not only does this ignore the challenges of training machine
learning models on more subjective data and testing them with much noisier
data, but there is also a clear disconnect in progress between advancing the
development of convolutional neural networks and the goal of emotionally
cognizant artificial intelligence. By training a new model to include this type
of information with a rich comprehension of psycho-acoustic properties, not
only can models be trained to recognize information within extremely noisy
data, but advancement can be made toward more complex biofeedback applications
-- including creating a model which could recognize emotions given any human

is arbitrarily small and the number of variables, or arity $n$, is $O(\log s)$,
then we can derandomize blackbox PIT for general circuits in quasipolynomial
time. This also establishes that either E$\not\subseteq$\#P/poly or that

against individual-degree $a'=\omega(1)$ polynomials that are computable by a
size-$s$ arity-$(\log s)$ $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit (note: $\Pi$ fanin may be
$s$). Alternatively, we claim that, to understand VP one only needs to find
hitting-sets, for depth-$3$, that have a small parameterized complexity.
Another tiny family of interest is when we restrict the arity $n=\omega(1)$ to
be arbitrarily small. We show that if we can design poly($s,\mu(n)$)-time
hitting-sets for size-$s$ arity-$n$ $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\wedge$ circuits

reduction} for PIT-- to solve the general problem completely it suffices to
find a blackbox PIT with time-complexity $sd2^{O(n)}$. We give several examples

devising poly-time hitting-sets, but the same question for their $s$-variate

a model of communication based on a random walk on an undirected graph, the
optimal set over all sets of the same or smaller cardinality minimizes the sum
of the mean first arrival times to the set by walkers starting at nodes outside
the set. The problem originates from the study of the spread of information or
consensus in a network and was introduced in this form by V.Borkar et al. in

estimating the fastest rate of convergence to consensus of so-called leader
follower systems leads to a consideration of the same optimization problem.
  The set function $F$ to be minimized is supermodular and therefore the greedy
algorithm is commonly used to construct optimal sets or their approximations.
In this paper, the problem is reformulated so that the search for solutions is
restricted to optimal and near optimal subsets of the graph. We prove
sufficient conditions for the existence of a greedoid structure that contains
feasible optimal and near optimal sets. It is therefore possible we conjecture,

terminal-style features like error pretty-printing, subexpressions

it. These terms can be incomplete, therefore the typechecking algorithm uses
unification to try to construct the missing subterms. Bull uses the syntax of

active area of research within the field of parameterized complexity. As a
relevant example, Gajarsk{\`y} et al. [ESA 2013] proved that every graph
problem satisfying a property called finite integer index admits a linear
kernel on graphs of bounded expansion and an almost linear kernel on nowhere
dense graphs, parameterized by the size of a $c$-treedepth modulator, which is
a vertex set whose removal results in a graph of treedepth at most $c$, where
$c \geq 1$ is a fixed integer. The authors left as further research to
investigate this parameter on general graphs, and in particular to find
problems that, while admitting polynomial kernels on sparse graphs, behave
differently on general graphs.
  In this article we answer this question by finding two very natural such
problems: we prove that Vertex Cover admits a polynomial kernel on general
graphs for any integer $c \geq 1$, and that Dominating Set does not for any
integer $c \geq 2$ even on degenerate graphs, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq
\text{coNP}/\text{poly}$. For the positive result, we build on the techniques
of Jansen and Bodlaender [STACS 2011], and for the negative result we use a
polynomial parameter transformation for $c\geq 3$ and an OR-cross-composition
for $c = 2$. As existing results imply that Dominating Set admits a polynomial

time and space complexity provably better than classic data structures for
hierarchical memories, such as B-trees, and modern learned indexes. We call our
solution the Piecewise Geometric Model index (PGM-index) because it turns the
indexing of a sequence of keys into the coverage of a sequence of 2D-points via
linear models (i.e. segments) suitably learned to trade query time vs space
efficiency. This idea comes from some known heuristic results which we
strengthen by showing that the minimal number of such segments can be computed
via known and optimal streaming algorithms. Our index is then obtained by
recursively applying this geometric idea that guarantees a smoothed adaptation
to the ""geometric complexity"" of the input data. Finally, we propose a variant
of the index that adapts not only to the distribution of the dictionary keys
but also to their access frequencies, thus obtaining the first
distribution-aware learned index.
  The second main contribution of this paper is the proposal and study of the
concept of Multicriteria Data Structure, namely one that asks a data structure
to adapt in an automatic way to the constraints imposed by the application of
use. We show that our index is a multicriteria data structure because its
significant flexibility in storage and query time can be exploited by a
properly designed optimisation algorithm that efficiently finds its best design

Mammography poses important challenges that are not present in other computer

with whole image labelling and data with pixel-wise annotations, leading to
better accuracy and interpretability even with a small number of images. Our
interpretable models are able to highlight the classification-relevant parts of
the image, whereas other methods highlight healthy tissue and confounding

processes in the queueing study of blockchain systems, which can provide
analysis both for the stationary performance measures and for the sojourn times

generalize the two-stage batch-service queueing model studied in Li et al.
\cite{Li:2018} both ``from exponential to phase-type"" service times and ``from
Poisson to MAP"" transaction arrivals. In general, the MAP transaction arrivals
and the two stages of PH service times make our blockchain queue more suitable
to various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial random
factors, for example, the mining processes, the block-generations, the
blockchain-building and so forth. For such a more general blockchain queueing
model, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) By using the
matrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the
blockchain system. Then we provide simple expressions for the average number of
transactions in the queueing waiting room, and the average number of
transactions in the block. (2) However, comparing with Li et al.
\cite{Li:2018}, analysis of the transaction-confirmation time becomes very
difficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To
overcome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first
passage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the

was only recently obtained by using an intricate rounding algorithm that
achieves an approximation guarantee in the hundreds.

comes close to settling the integrality gap (after necessary preprocessing),

reducing to special tree instances, and then solves such instances optimally.

the class of problems solvable by use of stochasticity under the Random
Polynomial time (RP) model is larger than the class of those solvable in
deterministic polynomial time (P). However, this question is only open for
Turing Machines, not for Random Access Machines (RAMs).
  Simon (1981) was able to show that for a sufficiently equipped Random Access
Machine, the ability to switch states nondeterministically does not entail any
computational advantage. However, in the same paper, Simon describes a
different (and arguably more natural) scenario for stochasticity under the RAM
model. According to Simon's proposal, instead of receiving a new random bit at
each execution step, the RAM program is able to execute the pseudofunction
$\textit{RAND}(y)$, which returns a uniformly distributed random integer in the
range $[0,y)$. Whether the ability to allot a random integer in this fashion is
more powerful than the ability to allot a random bit remained an open question
for the last 30 years.
  In this paper, we close Simon's open problem, by fully characterising the
class of languages recognisable in polynomial time by each of the RAMs

not a well-understood aspect of human intelligence. Repurposing arises in
everyday situations such as finding substitutes for missing ingredients when
cooking, or for unavailable tools when doing DIY. It also arises in critical,
unprecedented situations needing crisis management. After natural disasters and
during wartime, people must repurpose the materials and processes available to
make shelter, distribute food, etc. Repurposing is equally important in
professional life (e.g. clinicians often repurpose medicines off-license) and
in addressing societal challenges (e.g. finding new roles for waste products,).
Despite the importance of repurposing, the topic has received little academic
attention. By considering examples from a variety of domains such as every-day
activities, drug repurposing and natural disasters, we identify some principle
characteristics of the process and describe some technical challenges that
would be involved in modelling and simulating it. We consider cases of both
substitution, i.e. finding an alternative for a missing resource, and
exploitation, i.e. identifying a new role for an existing resource. We argue

the part of a message, and virality, defined as the probability that it be sent
along, is of significant theoretical and practical importance, e.g. for viral
marketing. A quantitative study of emailing of articles from the NY Times finds
a strong link between positive affect and virality, and, based on psychological
theories it is concluded that this relation is universally valid. The
conclusion appears to be in contrast with classic theory of diffusion in news
media emphasizing negative affect as promoting propagation. In this paper we
explore the apparent paradox in a quantitative analysis of information
diffusion on Twitter. Twitter is interesting in this context as it has been
shown to present both the characteristics social and news media. The basic
measure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet. Twitter is
different from email in that retweeting does not depend on pre-existing social
relations, but often occur among strangers, thus in this respect Twitter may be
more similar to traditional news media. We therefore hypothesize that negative
news content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive
sentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A
complete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of
tweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train
a classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news
information. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in
the news segment, but not in the non-news segment. We conclude that the
relation between affect and virality is more complex than expected based on the

of delta modeling [8, 9, 24]. A functional variant is described by a delta
encapsulating a set of modifications. A sequence of deltas can be applied to a
core product to derive the desired variant. We present a prototypical

  Location","For a given network, a backbone is an overlay network consisting of a
connected dominating set with additional accessibility properties. Once a
backbone is created for a network, it can be utilized for fast communication
amongst the nodes of the network.
  The Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model has become the
standard for modeling communication among devices in wireless networks. For
this model, the community has pondered what the most realistic solutions for
communication problems in wireless networks would look like. Such solutions
would have the characteristic that they would make the least number of
assumptions about the availability of information about the participating
nodes. Solving problems when nothing at all is known about the network and
having nodes just start participating would be ideal. However, this is quite
challenging and most likely not feasible. The pragmatic approach is then to
make meaningful assumptions about the available information and present
efficient solutions based on this information.
  We present a solution for creation of backbone in the SINR model, when nodes
do not have access to their physical coordinates or the coordinates of other
nodes in the network. This restriction models the deployment of nodes in
various situations for sensing hurricanes, cyclones, and so on, where only
information about nodes prior to their deployment may be known but not their
actual locations post deployment. We assume that nodes have access to knowledge
of their label, the labels of nodes within their neighborhood, the range from
which labels are taken $[N]$ and the total number of participating nodes $n$.
We also assume that nodes wake up spontaneously. We present an efficient
deterministic protocol to create a backbone with a round complexity of
$O(\Delta \lg^2 N)$.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

for speaker-independent models. In this paper, we investigate adapting an
automatic speech recognition (ASR) acoustic model (AM) for the visual speech

The AM is then adapted to the visual speech synthesis domain using ninety hours
of synchronized audio-visual speech. Using a subjective assessment test, we
compared the performance of the AM-initialized DNN to one with a random
initialization. The results show that viewers significantly prefer animations

being rare, are overrepresented when averaging over friends. Using a sample of
the Twitter firehose, we confirm that the friendship paradox holds for >98% of
Twitter users. Because of the directed nature of the follower graph on Twitter,
we are further able to confirm more detailed forms of the friendship paradox:
everyone you follow or who follows you has more friends and followers than you.
This is likely caused by a correlation we demonstrate between Twitter activity,
number of friends, and number of followers. In addition, we discover two new
paradoxes: the virality paradox that states ""your friends receive more viral
content than you, on average,"" and the activity paradox, which states ""your
friends are more active than you, on average."" The latter paradox is important
in regulating online communication. It may result in users having difficulty
maintaining optimal incoming information rates, because following additional
users causes the volume of incoming tweets to increase super-linearly. While
users may compensate for increased information flow by increasing their own
activity, users become information overloaded when they receive more
information than they are able or willing to process. We compare the average

  placements of relay nodes in mission critical wireless networks","In critical infrastructures like airports, much care has to be devoted in
protecting radio communication networks from external electromagnetic
interference. Protection of such mission-critical radio communication networks
is usually tackled by exploiting radiogoniometers: at least three suitably
deployed radiogoniometers, and a gateway gathering information from them,
permit to monitor and localise sources of electromagnetic emissions that are
not supposed to be present in the monitored area. Typically, radiogoniometers
are connected to the gateway through relay nodes. As a result, some degree of
fault-tolerance for the network of relay nodes is essential in order to offer a
reliable monitoring. On the other hand, deployment of relay nodes is typically
quite expensive. As a result, we have two conflicting requirements: minimise
costs while guaranteeing a given fault-tolerance. In this paper, we address the
problem of computing a deployment for relay nodes that minimises the relay node
network cost while at the same time guaranteeing proper working of the network
even when some of the relay nodes (up to a given maximum number) become faulty
(fault-tolerance). We show that, by means of a computation-intensive

trends. Even for the same request type, latency may vary from one request to
another. These variations can occur due to several reasons on different levels
of the software stack: operating system, network, software libraries,
application code or others. Furthermore, a request may involve several Remote
Procedure Calls (RPC), where each call can be subject to performance variation.
Performance analysts inspect distributed traces and seek for recurrent patterns
in trace attributes, such as RPCs execution time, in order to cluster traces in
which variations may be induced by the same cause. Clustering ""similar"" traces
is a prerequisite for effective performance debugging. Given the scale of the
problem, such activity can be tedious and expensive. In this paper, we present
an automated approach that detects relevant RPCs execution time patterns
associated to request latency degradation, i.e. latency degradation patterns.
The presented approach is based on a genetic search algorithm driven by an
information retrieval relevance metric and an optimized fitness evaluation.
Each latency degradation pattern identifies a cluster of requests subject to
latency degradation with similar patterns in RPCs execution time. We show on a
microservice-based application case study that the proposed approach can
effectively detect clusters identified by artificially injected latency
degradation patterns. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms
in terms of F-score a state-of-art approach for latency profile analysis and

contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. Sharir, Pnueli and Hart [SIAM J.
Comput. 13(1984)292-314] presented a general method for proving properties of
probabilistic programs, in which a probabilistic program is modeled by a Markov
chain and an assertion on the output distribution is extended into an invariant
assertion on all intermediate distributions. Their method is essentially a
probabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method.
In this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains
which are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart
method can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the
Schr\""odinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables. In
particular, a completeness theorem for the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart verification
method of quantum programs is established. 2. As indicated by the completeness
theorem, the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method is in principle effective for verifying
all properties of quantum programs that can be expressed in terms of Hermitian
operators (observables). But it is not feasible for many practical applications
because of the complicated calculation involved in the verification. For the
case of finite-dimensional state spaces, we find a method for verification of
quantum programs much simpler than the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method by employing
the matrix representation of super-operators and Jordan decomposition of

products inexpensively, and that self-replication is an effective approach to
very low-cost manufacturing. The research presented here is intended to be a
step towards this vision. In previous work (JohnnyVon 1.0), we simulated
machines that bonded together to form self-replicating strands. There were two
types of machines (called types 0 and 1), which enabled strands to encode
arbitrary bit strings. However, the information encoded in the strands had no
functional role in the simulation. The information was replicated without being
interpreted, which was a significant limitation for potential manufacturing
applications. In the current work (JohnnyVon 2.0), the information in a strand
is interpreted as instructions for assembling a polygonal mesh. There are now
four types of machines and the information encoded in a strand determines how
it folds. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight
(although they flex slightly due to virtual forces acting on the machines), or
in a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By
choosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a
variety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial
unfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates
by bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the
encoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form
a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured

PL-VINS, a real-time optimization-based monocular VINS method with point and

instead of the pose estimation problem, which becomes the bottleneck for the
real-time performance due to its high computational cost. In this paper, a
modified LSD algorithm is presented by studying a hidden parameter tuning and
length rejection strategy. The modified LSD can run at least three times as
fast as LSD. Further, by representing space lines with the Pl\""{u}cker

  Lattices","In this paper, we study the Learning With Errors problem and its binary
variant, where secrets and errors are binary or taken in a small interval. We
introduce a new variant of the Blum, Kalai and Wasserman algorithm, relying on
a quantization step that generalizes and fine-tunes modulus switching. In
general this new technique yields a significant gain in the constant in front
of the exponent in the overall complexity. We illustrate this by solving p
within half a day a LWE instance with dimension n = 128, modulus $q = n^2$,
Gaussian noise $\alpha = 1/(\sqrt{n/\pi} \log^2 n)$ and binary secret, using
$2^{28}$ samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time
complexity of $2^{74}$ with $2^{60}$ samples for the same parameters. We then
introduce variants of BDD, GapSVP and UniqueSVP, where the target point is
required to lie in the fundamental parallelepiped, and show how the previous
algorithm is able to solve these variants in subexponential time. Moreover, we
also show how the previous algorithm can be used to solve the BinaryLWE problem
with n samples in subexponential time $2^{(\ln 2/2+o(1))n/\log \log n}$. This
analysis does not require any heuristic assumption, contrary to other algebraic
approaches; instead, it uses a variant of an idea by Lyubashevsky to generate
many samples from a small number of samples. This makes it possible to
asymptotically and heuristically break the NTRU cryptosystem in subexponential
time (without contradicting its security assumption). We are also able to solve
subset sum problems in subexponential time for density $o(1)$, which is of
independent interest: for such density, the previous best algorithm requires
exponential time. As a direct application, we can solve in subexponential time

show improvements over a data-driven model when the amount of available data is

given a branch decomposition of mim-width $w$, we give an
$n^{\mathcal{O}(w)}$-time algorithm that solves Feedback Vertex Set. This
provides a unified algorithm for many well-known classes, such as Interval

polynomial-time algorithms for other classes of bounded mim-width, such as
Circular Permutation and Circular $k$-Trapezoid graphs for fixed $k$. In all
these classes the decomposition is computable in polynomial time, as shown by

new classes of bounded mim-width. We prove a slight strengthening of the first

variation. Blind inverse gamma correction, which automatically determines a
proper restoration gamma value from a given image, is of paramount importance
to attenuate the distortion. For blind inverse gamma correction, an adaptive
gamma transformation method (AGT-ME) is proposed directly from a maximized

mathematical concise closed-form solution, resulting in efficient
implementation and accurate gamma restoration of AGT-ME. Considering the human

regression. In the first problem, the inverse of an unknown covariance matrix
of a multivariate normal distribution is estimated, under the assumption that
it is sparse. To this end, an l1 regularized log-determinant optimization

of proof complexity. Pebbling has proven a useful tool for studying
resolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different
subsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space
trade-offs. The typical approach has been to encode the pebble game played on a
graph as a CNF formula and then argue that proofs of this formula must inherit
(various aspects of) the pebbling properties of the underlying graph.
Unfortunately, the reductions used here are not tight. To simulate resolution
proofs by pebblings, the full strength of nondeterministic black-white pebbling
is needed, whereas resolution is only known to be able to simulate
deterministic black pebbling. To obtain strong results, one therefore needs to
find specific graph families which either have essentially the same properties
for black and black-white pebbling (not at all true in general) or which admit
simulations of black-white pebblings in resolution. This paper contributes to
both these approaches. First, we design a restricted form of black-white
pebbling that can be simulated in resolution and show that there are graph
families for which such restricted pebblings can be asymptotically better than
black pebblings. This proves that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, resolution
can strictly beat black-only pebbling, and in particular that the space lower
bounds on pebbling formulas in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008] are tight.
Second, we present a versatile parametrized graph family with essentially the
same properties for black and black-white pebbling, which gives sharp
simultaneous trade-offs for black and black-white pebbling for various
parameter settings. Both of our contributions have been instrumental in
obtaining the time-space trade-off results for resolution-based proof systems

achieve an objective and its adversary seeks to learn the agent's intentions
and prevent the agent from achieving its objective. The agent has an incentive
to try to deceive the adversary about its intentions, while at the same time
working to achieve its objective. The primary contribution of this paper is to
introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for the notion of deception
within the context of optimal control. The central notion introduced in the
paper is that of a belief-induced reward: a reward dependent not only on the
agent's state and action, but also adversary's beliefs. Design of an optimal
deceptive strategy then becomes a question of optimal control design on the
product of the agent's state space and the adversary's belief space. The
proposed framework allows for deception to be defined in an arbitrary control
system endowed with a reward function, as well as with additional
specifications limiting the agent's control policy. In addition to defining
deception, we discuss design of optimally deceptive strategies under
uncertainties in agent's knowledge about the adversary's learning process. In
the latter part of the paper, we focus on a setting where the agent's behavior
is governed by a Markov decision process, and show that the design of optimally
deceptive strategies under lack of knowledge about the adversary naturally
reduces to previously discussed problems in control design on partially
observable or uncertain Markov decision processes. Finally, we present two

algorithm addresses the technical challenge of transferring appearance
properties from one object to another of the same material when both objects

minerals, for example, have patterns composed of highly randomized layers of
organic and inorganic compounds. These materials pose a challenge as the

observations from a material property distribution in an exemplar to the
material property distribution of a target object to reconstruct its unknown
appearance. We use measured reflectance in 3-D bispectral textures to record
changing material property distributions. Our novel implementation of spherical
harmonics uses principles from chemistry and biology to learn relationships
between color (hue and saturation) and material composition and concentration
in an exemplar. The encoded relationships are transformed to the property
distribution of a target for color recovery and material assignment.

varying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera
positionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation
protocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation
algorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation.
Our method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It
can be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size

  Weights in Deep Networks","Overfitting is one of the critical problems in deep neural networks. Many
regularization schemes try to prevent overfitting blindly. However, they
decrease the convergence speed of training algorithms. Adaptive regularization
schemes can solve overfitting more intelligently. They usually do not affect
the entire network weights. This paper detects a subset of the weighting layers
that cause overfitting. The overfitting recognizes by matrix and tensor
condition numbers. An adaptive regularization scheme entitled Adaptive Low-Rank
(ALR) is proposed that converges a subset of the weighting layers to their
Low-Rank Factorization (LRF). It happens by minimizing a new Tikhonov-based
loss function. ALR also encourages lazy weights to contribute to the
regularization when epochs grow up. It uses a damping sequence to increment
layer selection likelihood in the last generations. Thus before falling the
training accuracy, ALR reduces the lazy weights and regularizes the network
substantially. The experimental results show that ALR regularizes the deep

  RL","Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) combine model-free (Mf)-RL
algorithms with model-based (Mb)-RL approaches to get the best from both:
asymptotic performance of Mf-RL and high sample-efficiency of Mb-RL. Inspired
by these works, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates online
learning for the Mb-trajectory optimization with off-policy methods for the
Mf-RL. In particular, two loops are proposed, where the Dynamic Mirror Descent
based Model Predictive Control (DMD-MPC) is used as the inner loop to obtain an
optimal sequence of actions. These actions are in turn used to significantly
accelerate the outer loop Mf-RL. We show that our formulation is generic for a
broad class of MPC based policies and objectives, and includes some of the
well-known Mb-Mf approaches. Based on the framework we define two algorithms to
increase sample efficiency of Off Policy RL and to guide end to end RL
algorithms for online adaption respectively. Thus we finally introduce two
novel algorithms: Dynamic-Mirror Descent Model Predictive RL(DeMoRL), which
uses the method of elite fractions for the inner loop and Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) as the off-policy RL for the outer loop and Dynamic-Mirror Descent Model
Predictive Layer(DeMo Layer), a special case of the hierarchical framework

refactor code. To benefit from such library evolution, the programmers of
client projects have to repetitively upgrade their library usages and adapt
their codebases to any library API breaking changes (e.g., API renaming). Such
adaptive changes can be tedious and error-prone. Existing tools provide limited
support to help programmers migrate client projects from old library versions
to new ones. For instance, some tools extract API mappings be-tween library
versions and only suggest simple adaptive changes (i.e., statement updates);
other tools suggest or automate more complicated edits (e.g., statement
insertions) based on user-provided exemplar code migrations. However, when new
library versions are available, it is usually cumbersome and time-consuming for
users to provide sufficient human-crafted samples in order to guide automatic
migration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, AutoUpdate, to further
improve the state of the art. Instead of learning from change examples, we
designed AutoUpdate to automate migration in a compiler-directed way. Namely,
given a compilation error triggered by upgrading libraries, AutoUpdate exploits
13 migration opera-tors to generate candidate edits, and tentatively applies
each edit until the error is resolved or all edits are explored. We conducted
two experiments. The first experiment involves migrating 371 tutorial examples

compilation errors for 92.7% of tasks. It eliminated such errors for 32.4% of

of the most widely adopted technologies for alleviating this problem, these
services intend to provide people with referrals of items they will appreciate
based on their preferences. IPTV users must ensure their sensitive preferences

of his/her profile. We utilize trust mechanism to augment the accuracy and
privacy of the recommendations. Trust heuristic spot users who are trustworthy
with respect to the user requesting the recommendation. Later, the neighborhood
formation is calculated using proximity metrics based on these trustworthy
users. Finally, Users submit their profiles in an obfuscated form without
revealing any information about their data, and the computation of
recommendations proceeds over the obfuscated data using secure multiparty
computation protocol. We expand the obfuscation scope from single obfuscation
level for all users to arbitrary obfuscation levels based on trustworthy
between users. In other words, we correlate the obfuscation level with
different trust levels, so the more trusted a target user is the less
obfuscation copy of profile he can access. We also provide an IPTV network

stabilize the fracture, restore the vertebral body height and alleviate pain.
Leakage is a common complication and may occur due to too much cement being

three-step Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Next, a per-vertebra
rigid registration to a healthy spine atlas restores its curvature. Finally, a
GAN-based inpainting approach replaces the fractured vertebra with an
estimation of its original shape. Based on this outcome, we then estimate the
maximum amount of bone cement for injection. We evaluate our framework by
comparing the virtual vertebrae volumes of ten patients to their healthy

dealing with formalisms with ""fusion"", i.e., where a computational step can not

for graph rewriting systems with non-linear rules, which are needed to cover
some relevant applications (such as the graphical encoding of calculi with name

fusion we leave aside stability and we characterise, as a natural
generalisation of prime algebraic domains, a class of domains, referred to as
weak prime domains. We then identify a corresponding class of event structures,

equivalence of categories. We show that connected event structures are exactly

  The problem of $k$ FT-BFS was first studied by Parter and Peleg [ESA13]. They
designed an algorithm to compute FT-BFS subgraph of size $O(n^{3/2})$. Further,
they showed how their algorithm can be easily extended to FT-MBFS requiring
$O(\sigma^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ space. They also presented matching lower bounds for
these results. The result was later extended to solve dual FT-BFS by Parter
[PODC15] requiring $O(n^{5/3})$ space, again with matching lower bounds.
However, their result was limited to only edge failures in undirected graphs
and involved very complex analysis. Moreover, their solution doesn't seems to
be directly extendible for dual FT-MBFS problem.
  We present a similar algorithm to solve dual FT-BFS problem with a much

directed graphs, and can be easily extended to handle dual FT-MBFS problem,

solve problems in areas such as diagnosis, planning, belief revision and

mechanism that provides a level of declarativity superior to that of Prolog,
and which has supported successful applications in fields such as parsing,
program analysis, and model checking. In this paper we show how to use tabled
logic programming to evaluate queries to abductive frameworks with integrity
constraints when these frameworks contain both default and explicit negation.
The result is the ability to compute abduction over well-founded semantics with
explicit negation and answer sets. Our approach consists of a transformation
and an evaluation method. The transformation adjoins to each objective literal
$O$ in a program, an objective literal $not(O)$ along with rules that ensure
that $not(O)$ will be true if and only if $O$ is false. We call the resulting
program a {\em dual} program. The evaluation method, \wfsmeth, then operates on
the dual program. \wfsmeth{} is sound and complete for evaluating queries to
abductive frameworks whose entailment method is based on either the
well-founded semantics with explicit negation, or on answer sets. Further,
\wfsmeth{} is asymptotically as efficient as any known method for either class
of problems. In addition, when abduction is not desired, \wfsmeth{} operating
on a dual program provides a novel tabling method for evaluating queries to
ground extended programs whose complexity and termination properties are

attack. So far only stochastic spread of an attack has been considered. In this

strategically drives the entire spread of attack and where interconnections
between nodes affect their susceptibility to be captured.
  We find that the strategies effective in the settings without contagion or
with stochastic contagion are no longer feasible when spread of attack is
strategic. While in the former settings it was possible to efficiently find
optimal strategies of the attacker, doing so in the latter setting turns out to
be an NP-complete problem for an arbitrary network. However, for some simpler
network structures, such as cliques, stars, and trees, we show that it is
possible to efficiently find optimal strategies of both players. For arbitrary
networks, we study and compare the efficiency of various heuristic strategies.

vector instruction set and an out-of-order engine dedicated to increase the
instruction level parallelism. Hence, related optimizations are currently
critical to improve the performance of applications requiring numerical
computation. Moreover, the use of a Java run-time environment such as the
HotSpot Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in high performance computing is a promising
alternative. It benefits from its programming flexibility, productivity and the
performance is ensured by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. Though, the JIT
compiler suffers from two main drawbacks. First, the JIT is a black box for
developers. We have no control over the generated code nor any feedback from
its optimization phases like vectorization. Secondly, the time constraint
narrows down the degree of optimization compared to static compilers like GCC
or LLVM. So, it is compelling to use statically compiled code since it benefits
from additional optimization reducing performance bottlenecks. Java enables to
call native code from dynamic libraries through the Java Native Interface
(JNI). Nevertheless, JNI methods are not inlined and require an additional cost
to be invoked compared to Java ones. Therefore, to benefit from better static
optimization, this call overhead must be leveraged by the amount of computation
performed at each JNI invocation. In this paper we tackle this problem and we
propose to do this analysis for a set of micro-kernels. Our goal is to select
the most efficient implementation considering the amount of computation defined

are forbidden patterns for deterministic automata (finite words) and for

allow the use of subwords on paths in finite graphs. This concept is formalized
as subword-patterns. For certain types of subword-patterns there exists a
non-deterministic logspace algorithm to decide their presence or absence in a

deciding the levels of the $\text{FO}^2$ quantifier alternation hierarchies.

for virtual environments and advance our understanding of fundamental concepts

increasingly dependent on their interpretability or explainability. Designing
explainable ML systems is instrumental to ensuring transparency of automated
decision-making that targets humans. The explainability of ML methods is also
an essential ingredient for trustworthy artificial intelligence. A key
challenge in ensuring explainability is its dependence on the specific human
user (""explainee""). The users of machine learning methods might have vastly
different background knowledge about machine learning principles. One user
might have a university degree in machine learning or related fields, while
another user might have never received formal training in high-school
mathematics. This paper applies information-theoretic concepts to develop a
novel measure for the subjective explainability of the predictions delivered by
a ML method. We construct this measure via the conditional entropy of
predictions, given a user signal. This user signal might be obtained from user
surveys or biophysical measurements. Our main contribution is the explainable
empirical risk minimization (EERM) principle of learning a hypothesis that
optimally balances between the subjective explainability and risk. The EERM
principle is flexible and can be combined with arbitrary machine learning
models. We present several practical implementations of EERM for linear models

  effects","Peer effects, in which the behavior of an individual is affected by the
behavior of their peers, are posited by multiple theories in the social
sciences. Other processes can also produce behaviors that are correlated in
networks and groups, thereby generating debate about the credibility of
observational (i.e. nonexperimental) studies of peer effects. Randomized field
experiments that identify peer effects, however, are often expensive or
infeasible. Thus, many studies of peer effects use observational data, and
prior evaluations of causal inference methods for adjusting observational data
to estimate peer effects have lacked an experimental ""gold standard"" for
comparison. Here we show, in the context of information and media diffusion on
Facebook, that high-dimensional adjustment of a nonexperimental control group
(677 million observations) using propensity score models produces estimates of
peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those from using a large
randomized experiment (220 million observations). Naive observational
estimators overstate peer effects by 320% and commonly used variables (e.g.,
demographics) offer little bias reduction, but adjusting for a measure of prior
behaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces bias by 91%.
High-dimensional models adjusting for over 3,700 past behaviors provide
additional bias reduction, such that the full model reduces bias by over 97%.
This experimental evaluation demonstrates that detailed records of individuals'
past behavior can improve studies of social influence, information diffusion,
and imitation; these results are encouraging for the credibility of some
studies but also cautionary for studies of rare or new behaviors. More
generally, these results show how large, high-dimensional data sets and

  data","Rapid urbanization places increasing stress on already burdened
transportation systems, resulting in delays and poor levels of service.
Billions of spatiotemporal call detail records (CDRs) collected from mobile
devices create new opportunities to quantify and solve these problems. However,
there is a need for tools to map new data onto existing transportation
infrastructure. In this work, we propose a system that leverages this data to
identify patterns in road usage. First, we develop an algorithm to mine
billions of calls and learn location transition probabilities of callers. These
transition probabilities are then upscaled with demographic data to estimate
origin-destination (OD) flows of residents between any two intersections of a
city. Next, we implement a distributed incremental traffic assignment algorithm
to route these flows on road networks and estimate congestion and level of
service for each roadway. From this assignment, we construct a bipartite usage
network by connecting census tracts to the roads used by their inhabitants.
Comparing the topologies of the physical road network and bipartite usage
network allows us to classify each road's role in a city's transportation
network and detect causes of local bottlenecks. Finally, we demonstrate an
interactive, web-based visualization platform that allows researchers,
policymakers, and drivers to explore road congestion and usage in a new

  An Enumeration Approach","The subset sum problem (SSP) can be briefly stated as: given a target integer
$E$ and a set $A$ containing $n$ positive integer $a_j$, find a subset of $A$
summing to $E$. The \textit{density} $d$ of an SSP instance is defined by the
ratio of $n$ to $m$, where $m$ is the logarithm of the largest integer within
$A$. Based on the structural and statistical properties of subset sums, we
present an improved enumeration scheme for SSP, and implement it as a complete
and exact algorithm (EnumPlus). The algorithm always equivalently reduces an
instance to be low-density, and then solve it by enumeration. Through this
approach, we show the possibility to design a sole algorithm that can
efficiently solve arbitrary density instance in a uniform way. Furthermore, our
algorithm has considerable performance advantage over previous algorithms.
Firstly, it extends the density scope, in which SSP can be solved in expected
polynomial time. Specifically, It solves SSP in expected $O(n\log{n})$ time
when density $d \geq c\cdot \sqrt{n}/\log{n}$, while the previously best
density scope is $d \geq c\cdot n/(\log{n})^{2}$. In addition, the overall
expected time and space requirement in the average case are proven to be
$O(n^5\log n)$ and $O(n^5)$ respectively. Secondly, in the worst case, it
slightly improves the previously best time complexity of exact algorithms for
SSP. Specifically, the worst-case time complexity of our algorithm is proved to
be $O((n-6)2^{n/2}+n)$, while the previously best result is $O(n2^{n/2})$.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Information for Resource Allocation","In this paper, a novel context-aware approach for resource allocation in

SCN's users are divided into two types: frequent users, who are regular users
of certain small cells, and occasional users, who are one-time or infrequent
users of a particular small cell. Given such \emph{context} information, each
small cell base station (SCBS) aims to maximize the overall performance
provided to its frequent users, while ensuring that occasional users are also
well serviced. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game in which the
SCBSs are the players. The strategy of each SCBS is to choose a proper power
allocation so as to optimize a utility function that captures the tradeoff
between the users' quality-of-service gains and the costs in terms of resource
expenditures. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and
uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game, and we show that
this condition is independent of the number of users in the network. Simulation
results show that the proposed context-aware resource allocation game yields

rather cast within an informal community of users and social context.
Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and
thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is
under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a
connection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit
that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended
to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or
indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.
Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring

disjunctive product, then the product is known to be multiplicative:
$f(G*H)=f(G)f(H)$.
  In this paper, we study graph products in the following non-standard form:
$f((G\oplus H)*J)$ where $G$, $H$ and $J$ are graphs, $\oplus$ and * are two

which have exactly $k$ lines of ${\cal L}$ passing below $v$. The complexity
(the maximum size) of the $k$-level in a line arrangement has been widely
studied. In 1998 Dey proved an upper bound of $O(n\cdot (k+1)^{1/3})$. Due to
the correspondence between lines in the plane and great-circles on the sphere,
the asymptotic bounds carry over to arrangements of great-circles on the
sphere, where the $k$-level denotes the vertices at distance at most $k$ to a
marked cell, the \emph{south pole}.
  We prove an upper bound of $O((k+1)^2)$ on the expected complexity of the
$k$-level in great-circle arrangements if the south pole is chosen uniformly at
random among all cells.
  We also consider arrangements of great $(d-1)$-spheres on the sphere
$\mathbb{S}^d$ which are orthogonal to a set of random points on
$\mathbb{S}^d$. In this model, we prove that the expected complexity of the

  Real-time, Adaptive Robotic Grasping","In recent times, object detection and pose estimation have gained significant
attention in the context of robotic vision applications. Both the
identification of objects of interest as well as the estimation of their pose
remain important capabilities in order for robots to provide effective
assistance for numerous robotic applications ranging from household tasks to
industrial manipulation. This problem is particularly challenging because of
the heterogeneity of objects having different and potentially complex shapes,
and the difficulties arising due to background clutter and partial occlusions
between objects. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a system
that performs real-time object detection and pose estimation, for the purpose
of dynamic robot grasping. The robot has been pre-trained to perform a small
set of canonical grasps from a few fixed poses for each object. When presented
with an unknown object in an arbitrary pose, the proposed approach allows the
robot to detect the object identity and its actual pose, and then adapt a
canonical grasp in order to be used with the new pose. For training, the system
defines a canonical grasp by capturing the relative pose of an object with
respect to the gripper attached to the robot's wrist. During testing, once a
new pose is detected, a canonical grasp for the object is identified and then
dynamically adapted by adjusting the robot arm's joint angles, so that the
gripper can grasp the object in its new pose. We conducted experiments using a
humanoid PR2 robot and showed that the proposed framework can detect
well-textured objects, and provide accurate pose estimation in the presence of
tolerable amounts of out-of-plane rotation. The performance is also illustrated

non-elementary complexity, and thus various restricted logical languages are
employed. In this paper we consider two such restricted specification logics,
linear temporal logic (LTL) and two-variable first-order logic (FO2). LTL is
more expressive but FO2 can be more succinct, and hence it is not clear which
should be easier to verify. We take a comprehensive look at the issue, giving a
comparison of verification problems for FO2, LTL, and various sublogics thereof
across a wide range of models. In particular, we look at unary temporal logic
(UTL), a subset of LTL that is expressively equivalent to FO2; we also consider
the stutter-free fragment of FO2, obtained by omitting the successor relation,
and the expressively equivalent fragment of UTL, obtained by omitting the next
and previous connectives. We give three logic-to-automata translations which
can be used to give upper bounds for FO2 and UTL and various sublogics. We
apply these to get new bounds for both non-deterministic systems (hierarchical
and recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov
chains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple
these with matching lower-bound arguments. Next, we look at combining FO2
verification techniques with those for LTL. We present here a language that
subsumes both FO2 and LTL, and inherits the model checking properties of both

that any pair of individuals are linked by a short chain of acquaintances

routing. Previously proposed dynamical processes enabled to demonstrate
experimentally (by simulations) that the small world phenomenon can emerge from
local dynamics. However, the analysis of greedy routing using the probability
distributions arising from these dynamics is quite complex because of mutual
dependencies. In contrast, our process enables complete formal analysis. It is
based on the combination of two simple processes: a random walk process, and an
harmonic forgetting process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the
individuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances.
We prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two
processes generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a
k-harmonic distribution. We analyze the performances of greedy routing at the
stationary regime of our process, and prove that the expected number of steps
for routing from any source to any target in any multidimensional lattice is a
polylogarithmic function of the distance between the two nodes in the lattice.
Up to our knowledge, these results are the first formal proof that navigability

classes of deadlock-free typed processes, here denoted L and K. The class L
stands out for its canonicity: it results from Curry-Howard interpretations of
linear logic propositions as session types. The class K, obtained by encoding
session types into Kobayashi's linear types with usages, includes processes not

  In this paper, we present two results. First, a set of three linear-time
preprocessing algorithms that remove certain substructures from a given SEFE
instance, producing a set of equivalent SEFE instances without such
substructures. The structures we can remove are (1) cutvertices of the union
graph $G^\cup = G^1 \cup G^2$, (2) most separating pairs of $G^\cup$, and (3)
connected components of $G$ that are biconnected but not a cycle.
  Second, we give an $O(n^3)$-time algorithm solving SEFE for instances with
the following restriction. Let $u$ be a pole of a P-node $\mu$ in the SPQR-tree
of a block of $G^1$ or $G^2$. Then at most three virtual edges of $\mu$ may

  Maximization","We consider the problem of maximizing the spread of influence in a social
network by choosing a fixed number of initial seeds, formally referred to as
the influence maximization problem. It admits a $(1-1/e)$-factor approximation
algorithm if the influence function is submodular. Otherwise, in the worst
case, the problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of
$N^{1-\varepsilon}$. This paper studies whether this worst-case hardness result
can be circumvented by making assumptions about either the underlying network
topology or the cascade model. All of our assumptions are motivated by many
real life social network cascades.
  First, we present strong inapproximability results for a very restricted
class of networks called the (stochastic) hierarchical blockmodel, a special
case of the well-studied (stochastic) blockmodel in which relationships between
blocks admit a tree structure. We also provide a dynamic-program based
polynomial time algorithm which optimally computes a directed variant of the
influence maximization problem on hierarchical blockmodel networks. Our
algorithm indicates that the inapproximability result is due to the
bidirectionality of influence between agent-blocks.
  Second, we present strong inapproximability results for a class of influence
functions that are ""almost"" submodular, called 2-quasi-submodular. Our
inapproximability results hold even for any 2-quasi-submodular $f$ fixed in
advance. This result also indicates that the ""threshold"" between submodularity

  Engines","Optimizing an interactive system against a predefined online metric is
particularly challenging, when the metric is computed from user feedback such
as clicks and payments. The key challenge is the counterfactual nature: in the
case of Web search, any change to a component of the search engine may result
in a different search result page for the same query, but we normally cannot
infer reliably from search log how users would react to the new result page.
Consequently, it appears impossible to accurately estimate online metrics that
depend on user feedback, unless the new engine is run to serve users and
compared with a baseline in an A/B test. This approach, while valid and
successful, is unfortunately expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
propose to address this problem using causal inference techniques, under the
contextual-bandit framework. This approach effectively allows one to run
(potentially infinitely) many A/B tests offline from search log, making it
possible to estimate and optimize online metrics quickly and inexpensively.

emergency should be supported by operational measures to avoid a second virus
spreading. Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and
significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with

masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards ""social distancing"") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built

Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies

the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable

(LFR), low-resolution (LR) video. A simple solution is to split it into two
sub-tasks: video frame interpolation (VFI) and video super-resolution (VSR).
However, temporal interpolation and spatial super-resolution are intra-related
in this task. Two-stage methods cannot fully take advantage of the natural
property. In addition, state-of-the-art VFI or VSR networks require a large
frame-synthesis or reconstruction module for predicting high-quality video
frames, which makes the two-stage methods have large model sizes and thus be
time-consuming. To overcome the problems, we propose a one-stage space-time
video super-resolution framework, which directly synthesizes an HR slow-motion
video from an LFR, LR video. Rather than synthesizing missing LR video frames
as VFI networks do, we firstly temporally interpolate LR frame features in
missing LR video frames capturing local temporal contexts by the proposed
feature temporal interpolation network. Then, we propose a deformable ConvLSTM
to align and aggregate temporal information simultaneously for better
leveraging global temporal contexts. Finally, a deep reconstruction network is

and application domains. Often in practice, an input graph can be considered as
an observed snapshot of a (potentially continuous) hidden domain or process.
Subsequent analysis, processing, and inferences are then performed on this
observed graph. In this paper we advocate the perspective that an observed
graph is often a noisy version of some discretized 1-skeleton of a hidden
domain, and specifically we will consider the following natural network model:
We assume that there is a true graph ${G^*}$ which is a certain proximity graph
for points sampled from a hidden domain $\mathcal{X}$; while the observed graph
$G$ is an Erd$\""{o}$s-R$\'{e}$nyi type perturbed version of ${G^*}$.
  Our network model is related to, and slightly generalizes, the
much-celebrated small-world network model originally proposed by Watts and
Strogatz. However, the main question we aim to answer is orthogonal to the
usual studies of network models (which often focuses on characterizing /
predicting behaviors and properties of real-world networks). Specifically, we
aim to recover the metric structure of ${G^*}$ (which reflects that of the
hidden space $\mathcal{X}$ as we will show) from the observed graph $G$. Our
main result is that a simple filtering process based on the \emph{Jaccard
index} can recover this metric within a multiplicative factor of $2$ under our
network model. Our work makes one step towards the general question of
inferring structure of a hidden space from its observed noisy graph

a serial and transitive relation on a universe, the collection of all the
regular sets of the generalized rough set is a lattice. In this paper, we use
the lattice to construct a matroid and then study relationships between the
lattice and the closed-set lattice of the matroid. First, the collection of all
the regular sets based on a serial and transitive relation is proved to be a
semimodular lattice. Then, a matroid is constructed through the height function

these GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more
complex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we
truncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty

two face images are close to each other in the input space they may remain
close after projection - but this is not desirable in the situation when these

is different from the tail of stationary queue length distribution for the
ordinary M/G/1 queue, and the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point
can extensively exist even if the service time distribution is heavy-tailed.
Furthermore, we analyze the exponential convergence of the current location of

  Distributed Systems","In this paper, Decentralized Periodic Approach for Adaptive Fault Diagnosis
(DP-AFD) algorithm is proposed for fault diagnosis in distributed systems with
arbitrary topology. Faulty nodes may be either unresponsive, may have either
software or hardware faults. The proposed algorithm detects the faulty nodes
situated in geographically distributed locations. This algorithm does not
depend on a single node or leader to detect the faults in the system. However,
it empowers more than one node to detect the fault-free and faulty nodes in the
system. Thus, at the end of each test cycle, every fault-free node acts as a
leader to diagnose faults in the system. This feature of the algorithm makes it
applicable to any arbitrary network. After every test cycle of the algorithm,
all the nodes have knowledge about faulty nodes and each node is tested only
once. With this knowledge, there can be redistribution of load, which was
earlier assigned to the faulty nodes. Also, the algorithm permits repaired node
re-entry and new node entry. In a system of n nodes, the maximum number of
faulty nodes can be (n-1) which is detected by DP-AFD algorithm. DP-AFD is
periodic in nature which executes test cycles after regular intervals to detect
the faulty nodes in the given distributed system.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

powerful tools such as variational inference (VI) exist. However, in contrast
to standard latent-variable models, parameter estimation with incomplete data
often requires estimating exponentially-many conditional distributions of the
missing variables, hence making standard VI methods intractable. We address
this gap by introducing variational Gibbs inference (VGI), a new
general-purpose method to estimate the parameters of statistical models from
incomplete data. We validate VGI on a set of synthetic and real-world

independent set that cannot be improved by certain (greedy) local moves, even
though it may not be globally optimal. It is trivial to construct an
independent set in a graph. It is easy to (greedily) construct a maximal
independent set. However, it is NP-hard to construct a globally-optimal
(maximum) independent set. In general, constructing a locally-optimal structure
is somewhat more difficult than constructing an arbitrary structure, and
constructing a globally-optimal structure is more difficult than constructing a
locally-optimal structure. The same situation arises with listing. The
differences between the problems become obscured when we move from listing to
counting because nearly everything is #P-complete. However, we highlight an
interesting phenomenon that arises in approximate counting, where the situation
is apparently reversed. Specifically, we show that counting maximal independent
sets is complete for #P with respect to approximation-preserving reductions,
whereas counting all independent sets, or counting maximum independent sets is
complete for an apparently smaller class, $\mathrm{\#RH}\Pi_1$ which has a
prominent role in the complexity of approximate counting. Motivated by the
difficulty of approximately counting maximal independent sets in bipartite
graphs, we also study the problem of approximately counting other
locally-optimal structures that arise in algorithmic applications, particularly
problems involving minimal separators and minimal edge separators. Minimal
separators have applications via fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms for

  Minimum Description Length Principle to Predict Household Income","One shirt size cannot fit everybody, while we cannot make a unique shirt that
fits perfectly for everyone because of resource limitation. This analogy is
true for the policy making. Policy makers cannot establish a single policy to
solve all problems for all regions because each region has its own unique
issue. In the other extreme, policy makers also cannot create a policy for each
small village due to the resource limitation. Would it be better if we can find
a set of largest regions such that the population of each region within this
set has common issues and we can establish a single policy for them? In this
work, we propose a framework using regression analysis and minimum description
length (MDL) to find a set of largest areas that have common indicators, which
can be used to predict household incomes efficiently. Given a set of household
features, and a multi-resolution partition that represents administrative
divisions, our framework reports a set C* of largest subdivisions that have a
common model for population-income prediction. We formalize a problem of
finding C* and propose the algorithm as a solution. We use both simulation

information to demonstrate our framework performance and application. The
results show that our framework performance is better than the baseline
methods. We show the results of our method can be used to find indicators of
income prediction for many areas in Thailand. By increasing these indicator
values, we expect people in these areas to gain more incomes. Hence, the policy
makers can plan to establish the policies by using these indicators in our
results as a guideline to solve low-income issues. Our framework can be used to
support policy makers to establish policies regarding any other dependent

a need for mathematical models and tools to systematically characterize the
reliability of the network. We propose two metrics for measuring the
reliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for
unicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the
end-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after
hearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF)
metric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node
retransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an
acknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet
forwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of
the end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities
and the underlying connectivity graph.
  We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to
construct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each
link is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of
decreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing

to understanding the underlying semantic information. However, the highly
complex and sophisticated representation of these artworks makes it difficult,
even for the experts, to analyze the scene. From the computer vision
perspective, the task of analyzing such artworks can be divided into
sub-problems by taking a bottom-up approach. In this paper, we focus on the
problem of recognizing the characters in Art History. From the iconography of
$Annunciation$ $of$ $the$ $Lord$ (Figure 1), we consider the representation of
the main protagonists, $Mary$ and $Gabriel$, across different artworks and
styles. We investigate and present the findings of training a character
classifier on features extracted from their face images. The limitations of
this method, and the inherent ambiguity in the representation of $Gabriel$,
motivated us to consider their bodies (a bigger context) to analyze in order to
recognize the characters. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the
bodies of $Mary$ and $Gabriel$ are able to learn person related features and
ultimately improve the performance of character recognition. We introduce a new
technique that generates more data with similar styles, effectively creating
data in the similar domain. We present experiments and analysis on three

Furthermore, planning the required maintenance actions in advance reduces
operation costs. In this article, the focus is on electrochemical cells. In
order to predict a cell's fault, the typical approach is to estimate the
expected voltage that a healthy cell would present and compare it with the
cell's measured voltage in real-time. This approach is possible because, when a
fault is about to happen, the cell's measured voltage differs from the one
expected for the same operating conditions. However, estimating the expected
voltage is challenging, as the voltage of a healthy cell is also affected by
its degradation -- an unknown parameter. Expert-defined parametric models are
currently used for this estimation task. Instead, we propose the use of a
neural network model based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The network
receives the operating conditions as input. The encoder's task is to find a
faithful representation of the cell's degradation and to pass it to the
decoder, which in turn predicts the expected cell's voltage. As no labeled
degradation data is given to the network, we consider our approach to be a
self-supervised encoder. Results show that we were able to predict the voltage
of multiple cells while diminishing the prediction error that was obtained by
the parametric models by 53%. This improvement enabled our network to predict a
fault 31 hours before it happened, a 64% increase in reaction time compared to
the parametric model. Moreover, the output of the encoder can be plotted,

Hierarchical Clustering (HC) algorithm is the current standard in clustering of

the use of Spectral Clustering (SC) algorithm. To make the algorithm
computationally cheap, we propose using sampling, specifically, Pivotal
Sampling that is probability based. Since application of samplings to
phenotypic data has not been explored much, for effective comparison, another
sampling technique called Vector Quantization (VQ) is adapted for this data as
well. VQ has recently given promising results for genome data.
  The novelty of our SC with Pivotal Sampling algorithm is in constructing the
crucial similarity matrix for the clustering algorithm and defining
probabilities for the sampling technique. Although our algorithm can be applied
to any plant genotypes, we test it on the phenotypic data obtained from about
2400 Soybean genotypes. SC with Pivotal Sampling achieves substantially more
accuracy (in terms of Silhouette Values) than all the other proposed
competitive clustering with sampling algorithms (i.e. SC with VQ, HC with
Pivotal Sampling, and HC with VQ). The complexities of our SC with Pivotal
Sampling algorithm and these three variants are almost same because of the
involved sampling. In addition to this, SC with Pivotal Sampling outperforms

the algorithm must be locally correct, which means that if the recursive calls

environment, we have solved these limitations for the client. However, in doing
so we have introduced a new problem, namely increased latency. Interactive
networked virtual environments such as games and simulations have existed for
nearly as long as the Internet and have consistently faced latency issues. We
propose a solution for negating the effects of latency for interactive

incorporated in the server's updates, which helps to synchronize actions on the
client-side and the results coming from the server. We refer to this approach

  Bridges using 2 Degrees of Freedom (2DOF): Experimental Validation","Railroad bridge engineers are interested in the displacement of railroad
bridges when the train is crossing the bridge for engineering decision making
of their assets. Measuring displacements under train crossing events is
difficult. If simplified reference-free methods would be accurate and
validated, owners would conduct objective performance assessment of their
bridge inventories under trains. Researchers have developed new sensing
technologies (reference-free) to overcome the limitations of reference
point-based displacement sensors. Reference-free methods use accelerometers to
estimate displacements, by decomposing the total displacement in two parts: a
high-frequency dynamic displacement component, and a low-frequency
pseudo-static displacement component. In the past, researchers have used the
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory formula to estimate the pseudo-static displacement
assuming railroad bridge piles and columns can be simplified as cantilever
beams. However, according to railroad bridge managers, railroad bridges have a
different degree of fixity for each pile of each bent. Displacements can be
estimated assuming a similar degree of fixity for deep foundations, but
inherent errors will affect the accuracy of displacement estimation. This paper
solves this problem expanding the 1 Degree of Freedom (1DOF) solution to a new
2 Degrees of Freedom (2DOF), to collect displacements under trains and enable
cost-effective condition-based information related to bridge safety.
Researchers developed a simplified beam to demonstrate the total displacement
estimation using 2DOF and further conducted experimental results in the
laboratory. The estimated displacement of the 2DOF model is more accurate than
that of the 1DOF model for ten train crossing events. With only one sensor
added to the ground of the pile, this method provides owners with approximately

intersections for each node. We show close connections between the problems of

The novelty of these nominal quantifiers is they are polarised in the sense
that `new' distributes over positive operators while `wen' distributes over
negative operators. This greater control of bookkeeping enables private names
to be modelled in processes embedded as formulae in MAV1. The technical
challenge is to establish a cut elimination result, from which essential
properties including the transitivity of implication follow. Since the system
is defined using the calculus of structures, a generalisation of the sequent
calculus, novel techniques are employed. The proof relies on an intricately
designed multiset-based measure of the size of a proof, which is used to guide
a normalisation technique called splitting. The presence of equivariance, which
swaps successive quantifiers, induces complex inter-dependencies between
nominal quantifiers, additive conjunction and multiplicative operators in the
proof of splitting. Every rule is justified by an example demonstrating why the
rule is necessary for soundly embedding processes and ensuring that cut
elimination holds.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Prediction and Biomarker Discovery","Molecular profiling data (e.g., gene expression) has been used for clinical
risk prediction and biomarker discovery. However, it is necessary to integrate
other prior knowledge like biological pathways or gene interaction networks to
improve the predictive ability and biological interpretability of biomarkers.
Here, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR)
framework with regularized term $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 +
\eta\bm{w}^T\bm{M}\bm{w}$, which can reduce to different penalties, including
Lasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different $\bm{M}$. This
framework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate
descent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the
computing speed. However, if those estimated $\bm{w}_i$ and $\bm{w}_j$ have
opposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not
perform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR
model with a new penalty $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 + \eta|\bm{w}|^T\bm{M}|\bm{w}|$
to consider the difference between the absolute values of the coefficients. And
we develop two efficient algorithms to solve it. Finally, we test our methods

computed with an object detection model to generate image descriptions.
However, recent studies propose to directly use scene graphs to introduce
information about object relations into captioning, hoping to better describe
interactions between objects. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the use
of scene graphs in image captioning. We empirically study whether using
additional scene graph encoders can lead to better image descriptions and
propose a conditional graph attention network (C-GAT), where the image
captioning decoder state is used to condition the graph updates. Finally, we
determine to what extent noise in the predicted scene graphs influence caption
quality. Overall, we find no significant difference between models that use
scene graph features and models that only use object detection features across
different captioning metrics, which suggests that existing scene graph
generation models are still too noisy to be useful in image captioning.
Moreover, although the quality of predicted scene graphs is very low in
general, when using high quality scene graphs we obtain gains of up to 3.3

nonstationarities in the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.
In this case, brain-machine interfaces (BMI) require adaptation of their
decoders to maintain high performance across time. One way to achieve this is
by use of periodical calibration phases, during which the BMI system (or an
external human demonstrator) instructs the user to perform certain movements or
behaviors. This approach has two disadvantages: (i) calibration phases
interrupt the autonomous operation of the BMI and (ii) between two calibration
phases the BMI performance might not be stable but continuously decrease. A
better alternative would be that the BMI decoder is able to continuously adapt
in an unsupervised manner during autonomous BMI operation, i.e. without knowing
the movement intentions of the user.
  In the present article, we present an efficient method for such unsupervised
training of BMI systems for continuous movement control. The proposed method
utilizes a cost function derived from neuronal recordings, which guides a
learning algorithm to evaluate the decoding parameters. We verify the
performance of our adaptive method by simulating a BMI user with an optimal
feedback control model and its interaction with our adaptive BMI decoder. The
simulation results show that the cost function and the algorithm yield fast and
precise trajectories towards targets at random orientations on a 2-dimensional

our unsupervised method is still able to generate precise trajectories and to

applications in many areas of computer science, including distributed
computing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of sampling random walks
efficiently in a distributed network and its applications. Given bandwidth
constraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain
random walk samples.
  All previous algorithms that compute a random walk sample of length $\ell$ as
a subroutine always do so naively, i.e., in $O(\ell)$ rounds. The main
contribution of this paper is a fast distributed algorithm for performing
random walks. We present a sublinear time distributed algorithm for performing
random walks whose time complexity is sublinear in the length of the walk. Our
algorithm performs a random walk of length $\ell$ in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\ell D})$
rounds ($\tilde{O}$ hides $\polylog{n}$ factors where $n$ is the number of
nodes in the network) with high probability on an undirected network, where $D$
is the diameter of the network. For small diameter graphs, this is a
significant improvement over the naive $O(\ell)$ bound. Furthermore, our
algorithm is optimal within a poly-logarithmic factor as there exists a
matching lower bound [Nanongkai et al. PODC 2011]. We further extend our
algorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k\ell D} + k)$ rounds. We also show that our algorithm can be
applied to speedup the more general Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
  Our random walk algorithms can be used to speed up distributed algorithms in
applications that use random walks as a subroutine, such as computing a random
spanning tree and estimating mixing time and related parameters. Our algorithm

guarantee good performance even when accounting for the cache misses due to
false sharing. Most of our HBP algorithms are derived from known

  Our approach to addressing false sharing costs (or more generally, block
misses) is to ensure that any task that can be stolen shares O(1) blocks with
other tasks. We use a gapping technique for computations that have larger than
O(1) block sharing. We also incorporate the property of limited access writes

  Games","One-counter MDPs (OC-MDPs) and one-counter simple stochastic games (OC-SSGs)
are 1-player, and 2-player turn-based zero-sum, stochastic games played on the
transition graph of classic one-counter automata (equivalently, pushdown
automata with a 1-letter stack alphabet). A key objective for the analysis and
verification of these games is the termination objective, where the players aim
to maximize (minimize, respectively) the probability of hitting counter value
0, starting at a given control state and given counter value. Recently, we
studied qualitative decision problems (""is the optimal termination value = 1?"")
for OC-MDPs (and OC-SSGs) and showed them to be decidable in P-time (in NP and
coNP, respectively). However, quantitative decision and approximation problems
(""is the optimal termination value ? p"", or ""approximate the termination value
within epsilon"") are far more challenging. This is so in part because optimal
strategies may not exist, and because even when they do exist they can have a
highly non-trivial structure. It thus remained open even whether any of these
quantitative termination problems are computable. In this paper we show that
all quantitative approximation problems for the termination value for OC-MDPs
and OC-SSGs are computable. Specifically, given a OC-SSG, and given epsilon >
0, we can compute a value v that approximates the value of the OC-SSG
termination game within additive error epsilon, and furthermore we can compute
epsilon-optimal strategies for both players in the game. A key ingredient in
our proofs is a subtle martingale, derived from solving certain LPs that we can
associate with a maximizing OC-MDP. An application of Azuma's inequality on
these martingales yields a computable bound for the ""wealth"" at which a ""rich
person's strategy"" becomes epsilon-optimal for OC-MDPs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Partially Observable Markov Decision Process","This paper describes a novel method for building affectively intelligent
human-interactive agents. The method is based on a key sociological insight
that has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,
but has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that
resource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective
consistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments
about identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient
affective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental
sentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent
with, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent
with, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This ""affect control
principle"" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In
this paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of
this principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively
intelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain
multiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability
distribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make
value-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively
intelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,
predicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking
actions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We
demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our
model can be used as an emotional ""plug-in"" for artificially intelligent

manufacturing, can be modeled using the NP-hard Independent Set problem (given
an undirected graph and an integer k, find a set of at least k pairwise
non-adjacent vertices). Here, one encounters special graph classes like 2-union
graphs (edge-wise unions of two interval graphs) and strip graphs (edge-wise
unions of an interval graph and a cluster graph), on which Independent Set
remains NP-hard but admits constant-ratio approximations in polynomial time. We
study the parameterized complexity of Independent Set on 2-union graphs and on
subclasses like strip graphs. Our investigations significantly benefit from a
new structural ""compactness"" parameter of interval graphs and novel problem
formulations using vertex-colored interval graphs. Our main contributions are:
  1. We show a complexity dichotomy: restricted to graph classes closed under
induced subgraphs and disjoint unions, Independent Set is polynomial-time
solvable if both input interval graphs are cluster graphs, and is NP-hard
otherwise.
  2. We chart the possibilities and limits of effective polynomial-time
preprocessing (also known as kernelization).

unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and

it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or
as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas),

indicators (KPIs) to track and validate the progress. Depending on the

implement a specific parsing algorithm using such a declarative method. Our
approach aims at producing all semantically distinct parse trees for a given
sentence. From this goal, normalization and efficiency issues arise, and we
deal with them by combining and extending existing strategies. We have
implemented a CCG parsing tool kit - AspCcgTk - that uses ASP as its main

particle beam crossing a quadrupole, a large number of particle revolutions in

numerically invariants of motion over a long time interval and to a substantial
computational cost, mostly related to the repeated evaluation of the magnetic
vector potential. In this paper, in order to reduce this cost, we first
consider a specific gauge transformation that allows to reduce significantly
the number of vector potential evaluations. We then analyze the sensitivity of
the numerical solution to the interpolation procedure required to compute
magnetic vector potential data from gridded precomputed values at the locations
required by high order time integration methods. Finally, we compare several
high order integration techniques, in order to assess their accuracy and
efficiency for these long term simulations. Explicit high order Lie methods are
considered, along with implicit high order symplectic integrators and
conventional explicit Runge Kutta methods. Among symplectic methods, high order
Lie integrators yield optimal results in terms of cost/accuracy ratios, but non

work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work
they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid
invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly
wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or
managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd
workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them
economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to
be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In
this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd
work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon
Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If
we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly
wage was $3.76. But, we estimated that crowd workers in our study spent 33% of
their time daily on invisible labor, dropping their median hourly wage to
$2.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers
depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor
category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved
around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming
invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly
watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched

structures dynamic. It is used extensively in geometric settings and in the
guise of so-called merge (or compaction) policies in big-data databases such as
Google Bigtable and LevelDB (our focus). Previous theoretical work is based on
worst-case analyses for uniform inputs -- insertions of one item at a time and
constant read rate. In practice, merge policies must not only handle batch
insertions and varying read/write ratios, they can take advantage of such
non-uniformity to reduce cost on a per-input basis.
  To model this, we initiate the study of data-structure dynamization through
the lens of competitive analysis, via two new online set-cover problems. For
each, the input is a sequence of disjoint sets of weighted items. The sets are
revealed one at a time. The algorithm must respond to each with a set cover
that covers all items revealed so far. It obtains the cover incrementally from
the previous cover by adding one or more sets and optionally removing existing
sets. For each new set the algorithm incurs build cost equal to the weight of
the items in the set. In the first problem the objective is to minimize total
build cost plus total query cost, where the algorithm incurs a query cost at
each time $t$ equal to the current cover size. In the second problem, the
objective is to minimize the build cost while keeping the query cost from
exceeding $k$ (a given parameter) at any time. We give deterministic online
algorithms for both variants, with competitive ratios of $\Theta(\log^* n)$ and
$k$, respectively. The latter ratio is optimal for the second variant.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(MEDP) in undirected graphs, and in particular, the integrality gap of the
natural multicommodity flow based relaxation for it. The integrality gap is
known to be $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ even for planar graphs due to a simple
topological obstruction and a major focus, following earlier work, has been
understanding the gap if some constant congestion is allowed.
  In this context, it is natural to ask for which classes of graphs does a
constant-factor constant-congestion property hold. It is easy to deduce that
for given constant bounds on the approximation and congestion, the class of
""nice"" graphs is nor-closed. Is the converse true? Does every proper
minor-closed family of graphs exhibit a constant factor, constant congestion
bound relative to the LP relaxation? We conjecture that the answer is yes.
  One stumbling block has been that such bounds were not known for bounded
treewidth graphs (or even treewidth 3). In this paper we give a polytime
algorithm which takes a fractional routing solution in a graph of bounded
treewidth and is able to integrally route a constant fraction of the LP
solution's value. Note that we do not incur any edge congestion. Previously
this was not known even for series parallel graphs which have treewidth 2. The
algorithm is based on a more general argument that applies to $k$-sums of

constant congestion bound. We then use this to show that such bounds hold for

parameterize the mapping from a set of lamination parameters on a coarse mesh

problems associated with traditional de-homogenization approaches and save time
correspondingly. To train the neural network, a two-step custom loss function

training is carried out without any use of or reference to the underlying
structural optimization problem, which renders the proposed method robust and

post-processing procedure utilizing a distance transform on the output field
skeleton is used to project the desired lamination widths onto the output field

demonstrate that the deep learning approach has excellent generalization

non-terminals (Steiner vertices) in the optimum solution. In contrast to this
we give an efficient parameterized approximation scheme (EPAS), which

Steiner Tree, such as Directed Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest. For neither of
these an EPAS is likely to exist for the studied parameter: for Steiner Forest
an easy observation shows that the problem is APX-hard, even if the input graph
contains no Steiner vertices. For Directed Steiner Tree we prove that
approximating within any function of the studied parameter is W[1]-hard.

  Graph-Evolution Learning","Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in
artificial intelligence. Applications in real-world time series should consider
two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies
among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. A
still open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning
approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep
learning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled
with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely,
this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series
forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent
learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph
Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate
relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal
data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships
(i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal
relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of
experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and
classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the
competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate

networks. Unfortunately, almost all of these games have the conceptual drawback
of being computationally intractable, i.e. computing a best response strategy

the field is to find tractable realistic network formation models.
  We address this challenge by investigating a very recently introduced model
by Goyal et al. [WINE'16] which focuses on robust networks in the presence of a
strong adversary who attacks (and kills) nodes in the network and lets this
attack spread virus-like to neighboring nodes and their neighbors. Our main
result is to establish that this natural model is one of the few exceptions
which are both realistic and computationally tractable. In particular, we
answer an open question of Goyal et al. by providing an efficient algorithm for
computing a best response strategy, which implies that deciding whether the
game has reached a Nash equilibrium can be done efficiently as well. Our

significant attention in the past few years, in view of their ability to

automated fashion. Examples of complex specifications of interest include
properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata
on infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such
properties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.
Symbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with
the property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or
implemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent
development of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been
quite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control
systems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques

state and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the
number of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we
propose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic
control systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only
input set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus
scalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two

can be used to approximate the full $3$-profile counts for a given large graph.
Further, we study the problem of estimating local and ego $3$-profiles, two

allows us to collect $2$-hop information without maintaining an explicit
$2$-hop neighborhood list at each vertex. This enables the computation of all
the local $3$-profiles in parallel with minimal communication.

it's functionality and overall performance. Many industrial applications rely
on task-specific gripper designs to ensure the system's robustness and
accuracy. However, the process of manual hardware design is both costly and
time-consuming, and the quality of the resulting design is dependent on the
engineer's experience and domain expertise, which can easily be out-dated or

automate the design of task-specific gripper fingers. We propose Fit2Form, a 3D
generative design framework that generates pairs of finger shapes to maximize
design objectives (i.e., grasp success, stability, and robustness) for target
grasp objects. We model the design objectives by training a Fitness network to
predict their values for pairs of gripper fingers and their corresponding grasp
objects. This Fitness network then provides supervision to a 3D Generative
network that produces a pair of 3D finger geometries for the target grasp
object. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D generative design
framework generates parallel jaw gripper finger shapes that achieve more stable

  using reaction coordinate proposals II: indirect reconstruction","We introduce a new micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo method (mM-MCMC) with
indirect reconstruction to sample invariant distributions of molecular dynamics
systems that exhibit a time-scale separation between the microscopic (fast)
dynamics, and the macroscopic (slow) dynamics of some low-dimensional set of
reaction coordinates. The algorithm enhances exploration of the state space in
the presence of metastability by allowing larger proposal moves at the
macroscopic level, on which a conditional accept-reject procedure is applied.
Only when the macroscopic proposal is accepted, the full microscopic state is
reconstructed from the newly sampled reaction coordinate value and is subjected
to a second accept/reject procedure. The computational gain stems from the fact
that most proposals are rejected at the macroscopic level, at low computational
cost, while microscopic states, once reconstructed, are almost always accepted.
This paper discusses an indirect method to reconstruct microscopic samples from
macroscopic reaction coordinate values, that can also be applied in cases where
direct reconstruction is cumbersome. The indirect reconstruction method
generates a microscopic sample by performing a biased microscopic simulation,
starting from the previous microscopic sample and driving the microscopic state
towards the proposed reaction coordinate value. We show numerically that the

accounted for using random fields and processes, which require knowledge about

  Structured Data","Information, stored or transmitted in digital form, is often structured.
Individual data records are usually represented as hierarchies of their
elements. Together, records form larger structures. Information processing
applications have to take account of this structuring, which assigns different
semantics to different data elements or records. Big variety of structural
schemata in use today often requires much flexibility from applications--for
example, to process information coming from different sources. To ensure
application interoperability, translators are needed that can convert one
structure into another. This paper puts forward a formal data model aimed at
supporting hierarchical data processing in a simple and flexible way. The model
is based on and extends results of two classical theories, studying finite
string and tree automata. The concept of finite automata and regular languages
is applied to the case of arbitrarily structured tree-like hierarchical data
records, represented as ""structured strings."" These automata are compared with
classical string and tree automata; the model is shown to be a superset of the
classical models. Regular grammars and expressions over structured strings are
introduced. Regular expression matching and substitution has been widely used
for efficient unstructured text processing; the model described here brings the
power of this proven technique to applications that deal with information
trees. A simple generic alternative is offered to replace today's specialised

of counting $k$-vertex induced subgraphs of a graph $G$ that satisfy a graph
property $\Phi$. Our main result establishes an exhaustive and explicit
classification for all hereditary properties, including tight conditional lower
bounds under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH):
  - If a hereditary property $\Phi$ is true for all graphs, or if it is true
only for finitely many graphs, then $\#\text{IndSub}(\Phi)$ is solvable in
polynomial time.
  - Otherwise, $\#\text{IndSub}(\Phi)$ is $\#\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete when
parameterised by $k$, and, assuming ETH, it cannot be solved in time $f(k)\cdot
|G|^{o(k)}$ for any function $f$.
  This classification features a wide range of properties for which the
corresponding detection problem (as classified by Khot and Raman [TCS 02]) is
tractable but counting is hard. Moreover, even for properties which are already
intractable in their decision version, our results yield significantly stronger
lower bounds for the counting problem. As additional result, we also present an
exhaustive and explicit parameterised complexity classification for all
properties that are invariant under homomorphic equivalence. By covering one of
the most natural and general notions of closure, namely, closure under
vertex-deletion (hereditary), we generalise some of the earlier results on this

  Robotic Systems","The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates
their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However,
guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an
unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We
propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability
methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The
method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee
constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process.
We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as
the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when
appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The
result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes
only when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence in
the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove
theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis
and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle.
Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the
quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient
reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a

assume an adversary that controls the injection time, source, and destination
for each packet injected. A set of paths for these packets is {\em admissible}
if no link in the network is overloaded. We present the first on-line routing
algorithm that finds a set of admissible paths whenever this is feasible. Our
algorithm calculates a path for each packet as soon as it is injected at its
source using a simple shortest path computation. The length of a link reflects
its current congestion. We also show how our algorithm can be implemented under
today's Internet routing paradigms.
  When the paths are known (either given by the adversary or computed as above)
our goal is to schedule the packets along the given paths so that the packets
experience small end-to-end delays. The best previous delay bounds for
deterministic and distributed scheduling protocols were exponential in the path
length. In this paper we present the first deterministic and distributed
scheduling protocol that guarantees a polynomial end-to-end delay for every
packet.
  Finally, we discuss the effects of combining routing with scheduling. We
first show that some unstable scheduling protocols remain unstable no matter
how the paths are chosen. However, the freedom to choose paths can make a
difference. For example, we show that a ring with parallel links is stable for
all greedy scheduling protocols if paths are chosen intelligently, whereas this

Kleinberg in 2000. However, from today's perspective his model has several
severe shortcomings that limit the applicability to real-world networks. In
order to give a more convincing explanation of the algorithmic small-world
phenomenon, we study decentralized greedy routing in a more flexible random
graph model (geometric inhomogeneous random graphs) which overcomes all
previous shortcomings. Apart from exhibiting good properties in theory, it has
also been extensively experimentally validated that this model reasonably
captures real-world networks.
  In this model, the greedy routing protocol is purely distributed as each
vertex only needs to know information about its direct neighbors. We prove that
it succeeds with constant probability, and in case of success almost surely
finds an almost shortest path of length {\theta}(loglog n), where our bound is
tight including the leading constant. Moreover, we study natural local patching
methods which augment greedy routing by backtracking and which do not require
any global knowledge. We show that such methods can ensure success probability
1 in an asymptotically tight number of steps.

We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based
discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and
COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples
extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of
semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on
a BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA,
neural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug
repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time
slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs
reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were
complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. Results: Accuracy
classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1= 0.854) in
classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion
models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1=0.417). Some known drugs
linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as some candidate
drugs that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled generation of

likelihood increases with Q; Q is increasing in the M -step and non-decreasing

E-steps; (2) The Shannon channel from the E-step is improper and hence the
expectation is improper. The author proposed the CM-EM algorithm (CM means

proper Shannon channel and maximizes G, average log-normalized-likelihood, in
the M-step. Neal and Hinton's Maximization-Maximization (MM) algorithm use F
instead of Q to speed the convergence. Maximizing G is similar to maximizing F.
The new convergence proof is similar to Beal's proof with the variational
method. It first proves that the minimum relative entropy equals the minimum
R-G (R is mutual information), then uses variational and iterative methods that
Shannon et al. use for rate-distortion functions to prove the global

from compressive measurements can depend on the distribution underlying the
non-zero elements of a sparse vector. However, the extent of these effects has
yet to be explored, and formally presented. In this paper, I empirically
investigate this dependence for seven distributions and fifteen recovery

performance of one algorithm over that of another must be prefaced by the
conditions for which this is observed to be true, including sparse vector
distributions, and the criterion for exact recovery; and 2) a recovery

industry of shellfish aquaculture. To predict when, where and in what

particularly at the species level are the Bivalvia. This difficulty arises from
the fact that fundamentally all bivalve larvae have a similar shape and colour.
Identification based on gross morphological appearance is limited by the
time-consuming nature of the microscopic examination and by the limited
availability of expertise in this field. Molecular and immunological methods
are also being studied. We describe the application of computational pattern
recognition methods to the automated identification and size analysis of

invariant moments; that is, the features are invariant to shift (position
within the image), scale (induced either by growth or differential image
magnification) and rotation. Images of a sample of scallop and non-scallop
larvae covering a range of maturities have been analysed. In order to overcome

systems to evaluate logical propositions is introduced and applied to Goedel's
incompleteness theorems. The truth value of a logical formula subject to a set
of axioms is computed from the solution to the corresponding system of
polynomial equations. A reference by a formula to its own provability is shown
to be a recurrence relation, which can be either interpreted as such to
generate a discrete dynamical system, or interpreted in a static way to create
an additional simultaneous equation. In this framework the truth values of
logical formulas and other polynomial objectives have complex data structures:
sets of elementary values, or dynamical systems that generate sets of infinite
sequences of such solution-value sets. Besides the routine result that a
formula has a definite elementary value, these data structures encode several
exceptions: formulas that are ambiguous, unsatisfiable, unsteady, or
contingent. These exceptions represent several semantically different types of
undecidability; none causes any fundamental problem for mathematics. It is
simple to calculate that Goedel's formula, which asserts that it cannot be
proven, is exceptional in specific ways: interpreted statically, the formula
defines an inconsistent system of equations (thus it is called unsatisfiable);
interpreted dynamically, it defines a dynamical system that has a periodic
orbit and no fixed point (thus it is called unsteady). These exceptions are not
catastrophic failures of logic; they are accurate mathematical descriptions of

transparently during movement. Mobile IP is the proposed standard by IETF.
Several studies, however, have shown that Mobile IP has several drawbacks, such
as triangle routing and poor handoff performance. Multicast-based mobility has
been proposed as a promising solution to the above problems, incurring less
end-to-end delays and fast smooth handoff. Nonetheless, such architecture
suffers from multicast state scalability problems with the growth in number of
mobile nodes. This architecture also requires ubiquitous multicast deployment
and more complex security measures. To alleviate these problems, we propose an
intra-domain multicast-based mobility solution. A mobility proxy allocates a
multicast address for each mobile that moves to its domain. The mobile uses
this multicast address within a domain for micro mobility. Also, aggregation is
considered to reduce the multicast state. We conduct multicast state analysis
to study the efficiency of several aggregation techniques. We use extensive
simulation to evaluate our protocol's performance over a variety of real and
generated topologies. We take aggregation gain as metric for our evaluation.
  Our simulation results show that in general leaky aggregation obtains better

trees. The distinguishing feature of our distance measures relative to
traditional quartet and triplet distances is their ability to deal cleanly with

these are nodes with more than two children; for unrooted trees, they are nodes
of degree greater than three.

parameter that weighs the difference between an unresolved triplet/quartet
topology and a resolved one. Our second class of measures are based on
Hausdorff distance. Each tree is viewed as a set of all possible ways in which

and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction
capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the
most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no
specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it
largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we
investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of
people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as
human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we
do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group
activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,
first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine
a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation
can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very
diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we
provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and
group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also
put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible
concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on
methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation
approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and
limitations in current literature along with possible future research
directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing
methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and
provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

clique or biclique (i.e., a single large clique or biclique plus diversionary
edges), our algorithm successfully provides an exact solution to the original
instance. For each problem, we provide two analyses of when our algorithm
succeeds. In the first analysis, the diversionary edges are placed by an
adversary. In the second, they are placed at random. In the case of random

basis for automatic program verification. The notion of first-order constrained
Horn clauses has recently been extended to higher-order logic by Cathcart Burn
et al. To exploit the remarkable efficiency of SMT solving, a natural approach
to solve systems of higher-order Horn constraints is to reduce them to systems
of first-order Horn constraints. This paper presents a defunctionalization
algorithm to achieve the reduction.
  Given a well-sorted higher-order constrained Horn clause (HoCHC) problem
instance, the defunctionalization algorithm constructs a first-order
well-sorted constrained Horn clause problem. In addition to well-sortedness of
the algorithm's output, we prove that if an input HoCHC is solvable, then the
result of its defunctionalization is solvable. The converse also holds, which
we prove using a recent result on the continuous semantics of HoCHC. To our
knowledge, this defunctionalization algorithm is the first sound and complete
reduction from systems of higher-order Horn constraints to systems of
first-order Horn constraints.
  We have constructed DefMono, a prototype implementation of the

patterns that best correlate with the data, according to the Pearson
determination coefficient R2. Of course, correlation does not imply causation.

unexpected correlations that may serve as clues to interesting phenomena, from
the pedagogical and even scientific point of view. As far as we know, this is

detection (or ``anomaly detection'') methods in machine learning. The data
representation of network traffic often determines the effectiveness of these
models as much as the model itself. The wide range of novel events that network
operators need to detect (e.g., attacks, malware, new applications, changes in
traffic demands) introduces the possibility for a broad range of possible
models and data representations. In each scenario, practitioners must spend
significant effort extracting and engineering features that are most predictive
for that situation or application. While anomaly detection is well-studied in
computer networking, much existing work develops specific models that presume a
particular representation -- often IPFIX/NetFlow. Yet, other representations
may result in higher model accuracy, and the rise of programmable networks now
makes it more practical to explore a broader range of representations. To
facilitate such exploration, we develop a systematic framework, open-source
toolkit, and public Python library that makes it both possible and easy to
extract and generate features from network traffic and perform and end-to-end
evaluation of these representations across most prevalent modern novelty
detection models. We first develop and publicly release an open-source tool, an

for load-balancing FMMs is to use the work load from the previous step as
weights to statically repartition the next step. The authors discuss in the
paper another approach based on data-driven execution to efficiently tackle
this challenging load-balancing problem. The core idea consists of breaking the
most time-consuming stages of the FMMs into smaller tasks. The algorithm can
then be represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where nodes represent
tasks, and edges represent dependencies among them. The execution of the
algorithm is performed by asynchronously scheduling the tasks using the QUARK

Specifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if

cup holder) by capturing the unique signal interference resulted from the
contact object's damping, reflection and refraction. We derive the short-time

a CNN-based binary classifier to discriminate the phone use between the
handheld and the handsfree status. Additionally, we design an adaptive
window-based filter to correct the classification errors and identify each

contrast to computing the Tutte polynomial of a $k$-vertex graph (that is, the
Tutte polynomial of a {\em graphic} matroid of dimension $k$---which is
representable in dimension $k$ over the binary field so that every vector has
two nonzero coordinates), which is known to be computable in $2^k k^{O(1)}$

$Y_i = X_i + Z_i,$ $i = 1, 2, ...,$ where the input $\{X_i\}$ satisfies a power
constraint and the noise $\{Z_i\}$ is a first-order moving average Gaussian
process defined by $Z_i = \alpha U_{i-1} + U_i,$ $|\alpha| \le 1,$ with white
Gaussian innovations $U_i,$ $i = 0,1,....$

scheme parallels the simple linear signalling scheme by Schalkwijk and Kailath

real-valued information-bearing signal at the beginning of communication and
subsequently refines the receiver's error by processing the feedback noise
signal through a linear stationary first-order autoregressive filter. The
resulting error probability of the maximum likelihood decoding decays
doubly-exponentially in the duration of the communication. This feedback

those of their descendants. A Merkle tree is often used for representing a

ensuring the correctness of their implementation is paramount.
  We show our formally verified implementation of the core part of Plebeia

the OCaml code extracted from the modules ported to F* is linked with the

confirmed that the binary passes all the unit tests of Plebeia.

of Plebeia: (1) Each tree-manipulating function preserves the invariants on the
data structure of a Plebeia tree and satisfies the functional requirements as a
nested key-value store; (2) Each function for serializing/deserializing a

show that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- TLS estimation
can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and
Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the
minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the
nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural
sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis
reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program (SDP)
resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our
third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the
lens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality
gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g.,
returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our
dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex
feasibility SDP. Numerical experiments across different perception problems,

  and Encryption","This paper discusses the application of known techniques, knowledge and
technology in a novel way for encryption. Two distinct and separate methods are
presented.
  Method 1: Alter the symbol set of the language by adding additional redundant
symbols for frequent symbols. This will reduce the high frequency of more
commonly used symbols. Hence, frequency analysis upon ciphertext will not be
possible. Hence, decryption will be possible.
  Method 2: Computers use binary base 2. Most encryption systems use ciphering
to convert data to ciphertext. The author presents the theory and several
possible implementations of a method for computers analogous to speaking
another language. This is done by using a binary base other than base 2. Ex.
Fibonacci, Phi or Prime.
  In addition, steganography may be used for creating alternate binary bases.
  This kind of encryption significantly increases the complexity of decryption.
First the binary base must be known. Only then, can decryption begin.
  This kind of encryption also breaks the transitivity of
plaintext-codebook-binary; the correlation of letters-ASCII-base2. With this
transitivity broken, decryption is logically impossible. Coupled with
encrypting the plaintext, binary encryption makes decryption uncrackable. It
may produce false positives--information theoretic secure, and requires much
more computing power to resolve than is currently used in brute force
decryption. Hence, the assertion that these combination of methods are
computationally secure--impervious to brute force.
  The proposed system has a drawback. It is not as compressed as a base2.

acceptable, since the goal is very strong encryption:

the fixed string and a suffix of most recent symbols of the stream is reported.
The cell-probe model is perhaps the strongest model of computation for showing

the first time holds even when $w$ is as small as a single bit.

We give a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n}/(\log\log n)^{3/2})$ which
applies for both problems. This second set of results relies both on our new
encoding scheme as well as a carefully constructed hard distribution.

programs with negation-as-failure allowed in clause bodies. In our semantics
the meaning of a program is, as in the classical case, the unique minimum model
in a program-independent ordering. We use an expanded truth domain that has an
uncountable linearly ordered set of truth values between False (the minimum
element) and True (the maximum), with a Zero element in the middle. The truth
values below Zero are ordered like the countable ordinals. The values above
Zero have exactly the reverse order. Negation is interpreted as reflection
about Zero followed by a step towards Zero; the only truth value that remains
unaffected by negation is Zero. We show that every program has a unique minimum
model M_P, and that this model can be constructed with a T_P iteration which
proceeds through the countable ordinals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M_P
can also be obtained through a model intersection construction which
generalizes the well-known model intersection theorem for classical logic
programming. Finally, we show that by collapsing the true and false values of
the infinite-valued model M_P to (the classical) True and False, we obtain a

between agent logics and agent programming frameworks. The main reason for this
problem of establishing a link between agent logics and agent programming
frameworks is identified and explained by the fact that agent programming
frameworks have not incorporated the concept of a `declarative goal'. Instead,
such frameworks have focused mainly on plans or `goals-to-do' instead of the
end goals to be realised which are also called `goals-to-be'. In this paper, a
new programming language called GOAL is introduced which incorporates such
declarative goals. The notion of a `commitment strategy' - one of the main
theoretical insights due to agent logics, which explains the relation between
beliefs and goals - is used to construct a computational semantics for GOAL.
Finally, a proof theory for proving properties of GOAL agents is introduced.

rely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computational

of SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show that
SE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo dataset for geographic logic

pathologies. The implementation of a new model of bone remodeling in PRISM has
led to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone
remodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows
to derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first
diagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is
currently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel
diagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here
simulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months)
negative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone
mineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the
patient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone
co-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone
density, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes
and cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations
of these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for
other systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are
delighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal
methods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies. In
particular our approach takes into consideration important properties of
biosystems such as multiscale and self-adaptiveness. The multi-diagnosis could

  Applications to Data Streams","In a $k$-party communication problem, the $k$ players with inputs $x_1, x_2,
\ldots, x_k$, respectively, want to evaluate a function $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_k)$ using as little communication as possible. We consider the
message-passing model, in which the inputs are partitioned in an arbitrary,
possibly worst-case manner, among a smaller number $t$ of players ($t<k$). The
$t$-player communication cost of computing $f$ can only be smaller than the
$k$-player communication cost, since the $t$ players can trivially simulate the
$k$-player protocol. But how much smaller can it be? We study deterministic and
randomized protocols in the one-way model, and provide separations for product
input distributions, which are optimal for low error probability protocols. We
also provide much stronger separations when the input distribution is
non-product.
  A key application of our results is in proving lower bounds for data stream
algorithms. In particular, we give an optimal $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}\log(N) \log
\log(mM))$ bits of space lower bound for the fundamental problem of
$(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximating the number $\|x\|_0$ of non-zero entries of an
$n$-dimensional vector $x$ after $m$ integer updates each of magnitude at most
$M$, and with success probability $\ge 2/3$, in a strict turnstile stream. We
additionally prove the matching $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}\log(N) \log \log(T))$
space lower bound for the problem when we have access to a heavy hitters oracle
with threshold $T$. Our results match the best known upper bounds when
$\epsilon\ge 1/\operatorname{polylog}(mM)$ and when $T =
2^{\operatorname{poly}(1/\epsilon)}$ respectively. It also improves on the
prior $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}\log(mM) )$ lower bound and separates the complexity

Chechik [PODC 2013], often have no means to tolerate failures, once the system
has been setup and started. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first
self-healing compact routing scheme. Besides, our schemes are developed for low
memory nodes, i.e., nodes need only $O(\log^2 n)$ memory, and are thus, compact
schemes.
  We introduce two algorithms of independent interest: The first is CompactFT,
a novel compact version (using only $O(\log n)$ local memory) of the
self-healing algorithm Forgiving Tree of Hayes et al. [PODC 2008]. The second
algorithm (CompactFTZ) combines CompactFT with Thorup-Zwick's tree-based
compact routing scheme [SPAA 2001] to produce a fully compact self-healing
routing scheme. In the self-healing model, the adversary deletes nodes one at a
time with the affected nodes self-healing locally by adding few edges.
CompactFT recovers from each attack in only $O(1)$ time and $\Delta$ messages,
with only +3 degree increase and $O(log \Delta)$ graph diameter increase, over
any sequence of deletions ($\Delta$ is the initial maximum degree).
  Additionally, CompactFTZ guarantees delivery of a packet sent from sender s
as long as the receiver t has not been deleted, with only an additional $O(y

consistency (SC) show undesirable effects when run under Power. We call these
programs not robust against the Power memory model. Formally, a program is
robust if every computation under Power has the same data and control
dependencies as some SC computation.
  Our contribution is a decision procedure for robustness of concurrent
programs against the Power memory model. It is based on three ideas. First, we
reformulate robustness in terms of the acyclicity of a happens-before relation.
Second, we prove that among the computations with cyclic happens-before
relation there is one in a certain normal form. Finally, we reduce the
existence of such a normal-form computation to a language emptiness problem.

chemistry. In contrast to standard Monte Carlo, KMC permits the description of
time dependent dynamical processes and is not restricted to systems in
equilibrium. Recently KMC has been applied successfully in modelling of novel
energy materials such as Lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. We consider
general solid state systems which contain free, interacting particles which can
hop between localised sites in the material. The KMC transition rates for those
hops depend on the change in total potential energy of the system. For charged
particles this requires the frequent calculation of electrostatic interactions,
which is usually the bottleneck of the simulation. To avoid this issue and
obtain results in reasonable times, many studies replace the long-range
potential by a short range approximation. This, however, leads to systematic
errors and unphysical results. On the other hand standard electrostatic solvers
such as Ewald summation or fast Poisson solvers are highly inefficient or
introduce uncontrollable systematic errors at high resolution. In this paper we
describe how the Fast Multipole Method by Greengard and Rokhlin can be adapted
to overcome this issue by dramatically reducing computational costs. We exploit
the fact that each update in the transition rate calculation corresponds to a
single particle move and changes the configuration only by a small amount. This
allows us to construct an algorithm which scales linearly in the number of
charges for each KMC step, something which had not been deemed to be possible
before. We demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability of the method

Ghilardi's characterization in the parameter-free case, leading to new proofs

unification is finitary for logics satisfying suitable frame extension

of image and video processing, such as predictive coding, for example, where an
image is compressed by coding the error sequence resulting from scandicting it.
Thus, it is natural to ask what is the optimal method to scan and predict a
given image, what is the resulting minimum prediction loss, and whether there
exist specific scandiction schemes which are universal in some sense.
  Specifically, we investigate the following problems: First, modeling the data
array as a random field, we wish to examine whether there exists a scandiction
scheme which is independent of the field's distribution, yet asymptotically
achieves the same performance as if this distribution was known. This question
is answered in the affirmative for the set of all spatially stationary random
fields and under mild conditions on the loss function. We then discuss the
scenario where a non-optimal scanning order is used, yet accompanied by an
optimal predictor, and derive bounds on the excess loss compared to optimal
scanning and prediction.

$\{c(i,j)\}_{i,j\in\F\cup\D}$, and bounds $k$, $m$. A feasible solution is a
pair $\bigl(S\sse\F,\sigma:\D\mapsto S\cup\{\mathsf{out}\}\bigr)$, where
$\sigma$ specifies the client assignments, such that $|S|\leq k$,
$|\sigma^{-1}(i)|\geq L_i$ for all $i\in S$, and
$|\sigma^{-1}(\mathsf{out})|\leq m$. In the {\em lower-bounded min-sum-of-radii

  We obtain an approximation factor of $12.365$ for \lbksro, which improves to
$3.83$ for the non-outlier version (i.e., $m=0$). These also constitute the
{\em first} approximation bounds for the min-sum-of-radii objective when we

from the standard paradigm used for such constrained problems, we obtain an

phenomena, namely of precarious, individuated, dissipative structures that can
be found in simple reaction-diffusion systems. Based on our analysis we suggest

  Evolution","Cloud controllers aim at responding to application demands by automatically
scaling the compute resources at runtime to meet performance guarantees and

strategies that are codified as a set of adaptation rules. However, for a cloud

less black-boxes, making it difficult at design time to define optimal or

developers in turn have limited knowledge of the cloud infrastructure. In this
paper, we propose learning adaptation rules during runtime. To this end, we

small surface-to-volume ratios. Use of such sets may reduce the number of cache
misses in computations of local operators having the iteration space as their
domain. First, we derive lower bounds on cache misses that any algorithm must
suffer while computing a local operator on a grid. Then, we explore coverings

operators which allow us to approach these lower bounds. For structured grids
we introduce a covering by successive minima tiles based on the interference
lattice of the grid. We show that the covering has a small surface-to-volume
ratio and present a computer experiment showing actual reduction of the cache
misses achieved by using these tiles. For planar unstructured grids we show
existence of a covering which reduces the number of cache misses to the level
of that of structured grids. Next, we introduce a class of multidimensional
grids, called starry grids in this paper. These grids represent an abstraction
of unstructured grids used in, for example, molecular simulations and the
solution of partial differential equations. We show that starry grids can be
covered by sets having a low surface-to-volume ratio and, hence have the same

flow of values between components. However, run-time monitoring and enforcement
of contracts imposes significant overhead and delays discovery of faulty
components to run-time.
  To overcome these issues, we present soft contract verification, which aims
to statically prove either complete or partial contract correctness of
components, written in an untyped, higher-order language with first-class
contracts. Our approach uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging
contracts as a source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values,
and employs an updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about
flow-sensitive facts. We prove the symbolic execution soundly approximates the
dynamic semantics and that verified programs can't be blamed.
  The approach is able to analyze first-class contracts, recursive data
structures, unknown functions, and control-flow-sensitive refinements of
values, which are all idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of
an off-the-shelf solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. The

reduction which is the analog of Cook reduction. These two reductions are
called K-reduction and C-reduction, respectively.

dealing with symmetric tasks.
  We establish various reducibility and irreducibility theorems with respect to

respect to the C-reduction, except when the resiliency degree is 1, in which

  Adaptive Cruise Control","With the benefits of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm, come along
unprecedented security challenges. Among many applications of inter-connected
systems, vehicular networks and smart cars are examples that are already rolled
out. Smart vehicles not only have networks connecting their internal components
e.g. via Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, but also are connected to the
outside world through road side units and other vehicles. In some cases, the
internal and external network packets pass through the same hardware and are
merely isolated by software defined rules. Any misconfiguration opens a window
for the hackers to intrude into vehicles' internal components e.g. central lock
system, Engine Control Unit (ECU), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or Adaptive
Cruise Control (ACC) system. Compromise of any of these can lead to disastrous
outcomes. In this paper, we study the security of smart vehicles' adaptive
cruise control systems in the presence of covert attacks. We define two
covert/stealth attacks in the context of cruise control and propose a novel
intrusion detection and compensation method to disclose and respond to such
attacks. More precisely, we focus on the covert cyber attacks that compromise
the integrity of cruise controller and employ a neural network identifier in
the IDS engine to estimate the system output dynamically and compare it against
the ACC output. If any anomaly is detected, an embedded substitute controller
kicks in and takes over the control. We conducted extensive experiments in

graph is $\alpha$-balanced if for every cut $S \subseteq V$, the total weight
of edges going from $S$ to $V\setminus S$ is within factor $\alpha$ of the
total weight of edges going from $V\setminus S$ to $S$. Several important
families of graphs are nearly balanced, in particular, Eulerian graphs (with
$\alpha = 1$) and residual graphs of $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate undirected
maximum flows (with $\alpha=O(1/\epsilon)$).
  We use the notion of balance to give a more fine-grained understanding of
several well-studied routing questions that are considerably harder in directed
graphs. We first revisit oblivious routings in directed graphs. Our main
algorithmic result is an oblivious routing scheme for single-source instances
that achieve an $O(\alpha \cdot \log^3 n / \log \log n)$ competitive ratio. In
the process, we make several technical contributions which may be of
independent interest. In particular, we give an efficient algorithm for
computing low-radius decompositions of directed graphs parameterized by
balance. We also define and construct low-stretch arborescences, a
generalization of low-stretch spanning trees to directed graphs.
  On the negative side, we present new lower bounds for oblivious routing
problems on directed graphs. We show that the competitive ratio of oblivious
routing algorithms for directed graphs is $\Omega(n)$ in general; this result
improves upon the long-standing best known lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
given by Hajiaghayi, Kleinberg, Leighton and R\""acke in 2006. We also show that
our restriction to single-source instances is necessary by showing an
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for multiple-source oblivious routing in
Eulerian graphs.

legal contracts, motivated by applications to legal recognition of smart
contracts on blockchain platforms. A number of axioms and rules of inference
are developed that can be used to justify a ``meeting of the minds''
precondition for contract formation from the fact that certain content has been
signed. In addition to an ``offer and acceptance'' process, the paper considers
``signature in counterparts'', a legal process that permits a contract between
two or more parties to be brought into force by having the parties
independently (possibly, remotely) sign different copies of the contract,
rather than placing their signatures on a common copy at a physical meeting. It
is argued that a satisfactory account of signature in counterparts benefits
from a logic with syntactic self-reference. The axioms used are supported by a
formal semantics, and a number of further properties of the logic are
investigated. In particular, it is shown that the logic implies that when a
contract has been signed, the parties do not just agree, but are in mutual

were grouped by physical proximity, supported by the intuitive notion that
competing and same-team players use relative position as a key tactical tool to
contribute to the team's objectives. The model was applied to a set of matches
from a major European national football league, with players' coordinates
sampled at 10Hz, resulting in approx. 60,000 network samples per match. We took
an information theoretic approach to measuring distance between samples and
used it as a proxy for the game dynamics. Significant correlations were found
between measurements and key match events that are empirically known to result
in players jostling for position, such as when striving to get unmarked or to
mark. These events increase the information distance, while breaks in game play
have the opposite effect. By analyzing the frequency spectrum of players'
cluster transitions and their corresponding information distance, it is
possible to build a comprehensive view of player's interactions, useful for
training and strategy development. This analysis can be drilled down to the
level of individual players by quantifying their contribution to cluster

computation show that such discrete advice can even make the difference between

the task is to find a set of vertices (called a target set) which activates the
whole graph during the following iterative process. A vertex outside the active
set becomes active if the number of so far activated vertices in its
neighborhood is at least its threshold.
  We give two parameterized algorithms for a special case where each vertex has
the threshold set to the half of its neighbors (the so-called Majority Target
Set Selection problem) for parameterizations by the neighborhood diversity and
the twin cover number of the input graph.
  We complement these results from the negative side. We give a hardness proof

which are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit
of the Berkeley dwarfs). These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware
architectures (single and multi-node) and alternative algorithms are explored.
Performance portability is addressed through the use of domain specific
languages.
  This deliverable contains the description of the characteristics of the
weather & climate dwarfs that form key functional components of prediction
models in terms of the science that they encapsulate and in terms of
computational cost they impose on the forecast production. The ESCAPE work flow
between work packages centres on these dwarfs and hence their selection, their
performance assessment, code adaptation and optimization is crucial for the
success of the project. At this stage of ESCAPE, a selection of established and
new dwarfs has been made, their documentation been compiled and the software
been made available on the software exchange platform. The selection of dwarfs
will be extended throughout the course of the project (see Deliverable D1.2).
  The current selection includes the spectral transforms, the cloud
microphysics scheme, two and three-dimensional elliptic solvers, a bi-Fourier

Computing frameworks such as MapReduce and Spark tackle this by replicating the
straggling tasks and waiting for any one copy to finish. Despite being adopted
in practice, there is little analysis of how replication affects the latency
and the cost of additional computing resources. In this paper we provide a
framework to analyze this latency-cost trade-off and find the best replication
strategy by answering design questions such as: 1) when to replicate straggling
tasks, 2) how many replicas to launch, and 3) whether to kill the original copy
or not. Our analysis reveals that for certain execution time distributions, a
small amount of task replication can drastically reduce both latency as well as
the cost of computing resources. We also propose an algorithm to estimate the

control the magnitude of the internal and external forces in the reciprocal
diagrams of 3D/Polyhedral Graphic statics (3DGS). In 3DGS, the form of the
structure and its equilibrium of forces is represented by two polyhedral
diagrams that are geometrically and topologically related. The areas of the
faces of the force diagram represent the magnitude of the internal and external
forces in the system. For the first time, the methods of this research allow
the user to control and constrain the areas and edge lengths of the faces of
general polyhedrons that can be convex, self-intersecting, or concave. As a
result, a designer can explicitly control the force magnitudes in the force
diagram and explore the equilibrium of a variety of compression and
tension-combined funicular structural forms. In this method, a quadratic
formulation is used to compute the area of a single face based on its edge
lengths. The approach is applied to manipulating the face geometry with a
predefined area and the edge lengths. Subsequently, the geometry of the
polyhedron is updated with newly changed faces. This approach is a multi-step
algorithm where each step includes computing the geometry of a single face and
updating the polyhedral geometry. One of the unique results of this framework
is the construction of the zero-area, self-intersecting faces, where the sum of
the signed areas of a self-intersecting face is zero, representing a member
with zero force in the form diagram. The methodology of this research can
clarify the equilibrium of some systems that could not be previously justified

  models through probabilistic machine learning and space-filling sampling","Data-driven constitutive modeling is an emerging field in computational solid
mechanics with the prospect of significantly relieving the computational costs
of hierarchical computational methods. Traditionally, these surrogates have
been trained using datasets which map strain inputs to stress outputs directly.
Data-driven constitutive models for elastic and inelastic materials have
commonly been developed based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which
recently enabled the incorporation of physical laws in the construction of
these models. However, ANNs do not offer convergence guarantees and are reliant
on user-specified parameters. In contrast to ANNs, Gaussian process regression
(GPR) is based on nonparametric modeling principles as well as on fundamental
statistical knowledge and hence allows for strict convergence guarantees. GPR
however has the major disadvantage that it scales poorly as datasets get large.
In this work we present a physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling
approach for isostropic and anisotropic materials based on probabilistic
machine learning that can be used in the big data context. The trained GPR
surrogates are able to respect physical principles such as material frame
indifference, material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, stress-free
undeformed configuration, and the local balance of angular momentum.
Furthermore, this paper presents the first sampling approach that directly
generates space-filling points in the invariant space corresponding to bounded
domain of the gradient deformation tensor. Overall, the presented approach is
tested on synthetic data from isotropic and anisotropic constitutive laws and
shows surprising accuracy even far beyond the limits of the training domain,

minimisation for event structures. Working in a class of event structures that

asymmetric, flow and bundle event structures), we study a notion of
behaviour-preserving quotient, referred to as a folding, taking (hereditary)
history preserving bisimilarity as a reference behavioural equivalence. We show
that for any event structure a folding producing a uniquely determined minimal
quotient always exists. We observe that each event structure can be seen as the
folding of a prime event structure, and that all foldings between general event
structures arise from foldings of (suitably defined) corresponding prime event
structures. This gives a special relevance to foldings in the class of prime
event structures, which are studied in detail. We identify folding conditions

improved by adding redundant parity checks to tighten the LP relaxation. We
prove that for LDPC codes, even if we include all redundant checks,
asymptotically there is no gain in the LP decoder threshold on the BSC under
certain conditions on the base Tanner graph. First, we show that if the graph
has bounded check-degree and satisfies a condition which we call asymptotic
strength, then including high degree redundant checks in the LP does not
significantly improve the threshold in the following sense: for each constant
delta>0, there is a constant k>0 such that the threshold of the LP decoder
containing all redundant checks of degree at most k improves by at most delta
upon adding to the LP all redundant checks of degree larger than k. We conclude
that if the graph satisfies a rigidity condition, then including all redundant
checks does not improve the threshold of the base LP. We call the graph
asymptotically strong if the LP decoder corrects a constant fraction of errors
even if the LLRs of the correct variables are arbitrarily small. By building on
the work of Feldman et al.(2007) and Viderman(2013), we show that asymptotic
strength follows from sufficiently large expansion. We also give a geometric
interpretation of asymptotic strength in terms pseudocodewords. We call the
graph rigid if the minimum weight of a sum of check nodes involving a cycle
tends to infinity as the block length tends to infinity. Under the assumptions
that the graph girth is logarithmic and the minimum check degree is at least 3,
rigidity is equivalent to the nondegeneracy property that adding at least
logarithmically many checks does not give a constant weight check. We argue
that nondegeneracy is a typical property of random check-regular graphs.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

power of edge devices, makes it vulnerable to attacks against privacy and
security. The privacy risk for a peer is that the model update she computes on
her private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those
private data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several
malicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning
process and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this paper we build a
federated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as
well as security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework
consists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating
peers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the
co-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in
deviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to
build a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides
incentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection
via differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates

items to support efficient nearest neighbors queries in high-dimensional
spaces. The basic idea of LSH is that similar items should produce hash
collisions with higher probability than dissimilar items.
  We study LSH for (not necessarily convex) polygons, and use it to give
efficient data structures for similar shape retrieval. Arkin et al. represent
polygons by their ""turning function"" - a function which follows the angle
between the polygon's tangent and the $ x $-axis while traversing the perimeter
of the polygon. They define the distance between polygons to be variations of
the $ L_p $ (for $p=1,2$) distance between their turning functions. This metric
is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling (and the selection of the
initial point on the perimeter) and therefore models well the intuitive notion
of shape resemblance.
  We develop and analyze LSH near neighbor data structures for several
variations of the $ L_p $ distance for functions (for $p=1,2$). By applying our
schemes to the turning functions of a collection of polygons we obtain
efficient near neighbor LSH-based structures for polygons. To tune our
structures to turning functions of polygons, we prove some new properties of
these turning functions that may be of independent interest.
  As part of our analysis, we address the following problem which is of
independent interest. Find the vertical translation of a function $ f $ that is
closest in $ L_1 $ distance to a function $ g $. We prove tight bounds on the
approximation guarantee obtained by the translation which is equal to the

prior state of the art with a combined dataset built to optimize both
within-category and across-category predictions. Our findings suggest that the
key prior memorability network had overstated its generalizability and was
overfit on its training set. Our new models outperform this prior model,
leading us to conclude that Residual Networks outperform simpler convolutional

Illustrations and interactive visualizations help both students and
professionals to comprehend mathematical material and to work with it. This
approach lends itself particularly well to geometrical objects. An example for
this category of mathematical objects are hyperbolic geometric spaces. When
Euclid lay down the foundations of mathematics, his formulation of geometry
reflected the surrounding space, as humans perceive it. For about two
millennia, it remained unclear whether there are alternative geometric spaces
that carry their own, unique mathematical properties and that do not reflect
human every-day perceptions. Finally, in the early 19th century, several
mathematicians described such geometries, which do not follow Euclid's rules
and which were at first interesting solely from a pure mathematical point of
view. These descriptions were not very accessible as mathematicians approached
the geometries via complicated collections of formulae. Within the following
decades, visualization aided the new concepts and two-dimensional versions of
these illustrations even appeared in artistic works. Furthermore, certain
aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity provided applications for
non-Euclidean geometric spaces. With the rise of computer graphics towards the
end of the twentieth century, three-dimensional illustrations became available
to explore these geometries and their non-intuitive properties. However, just

distributed video coding where, for decoding, error correction methods are
applied to improve predictions. Those error corrections sometimes fail which
results in decoded values worse than the initial prediction. Our code exploits
the fact that bit errors are relatively unlikely events: more than a few bit
errors in a decoded pixel value are rare. With a carefully designed counting
code combined with a prediction those bit errors can be corrected and sometimes
the original pixel value recovered. The error correction improves
significantly. Our new code not only maximizes the Hamming distance between
adjacent (or ""near 1"") codewords but also between nearby (for example ""near 2"")
codewords. This is why our code is significantly different from the well-known
maximal counting sequences which have maximal average Hamming distance.
Fortunately, the new counting code can be derived from Gray Codes for every
code word length (i.e. bit depth).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nested queries, and queries that invoke user-defined functions, which are
written using a mix of procedural and SQL constructs, are often used in such
applications. A straight-forward evaluation of such queries involves repeated
execution of parameterized sub-queries or blocks containing queries and
procedural code.
  An important problem that arises while optimizing nested queries as well as
queries with joins, aggregates and set operations is the problem of finding an
optimal sort order from a factorial number of possible sort orders. We show
that even a special case of this problem is NP-Hard, and present practical
heuristics that are effective and easy to incorporate in existing query
optimizers.
  We also consider iterative execution of queries and updates inside complex
procedural blocks such as user-defined functions and stored procedures.
Parameter batching is an important means of improving performance as it enables
set-orientated processing. The key challenge to parameter batching lies in
rewriting a given procedure/function to process a batch of parameter values. We
propose a solution, based on program analysis and rewrite rules, to automate
the generation of batched forms of procedures and replace iterative database
calls within imperative loops with a single call to the batched form.

Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks.
In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live
and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, we

thereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will
improve the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to
correctly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space
were examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable

a new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures (""pixelarity"")

global optimisation and decision problems. Their performance often depends on
good search order heuristics, refined over decades of algorithms research.
Parallel search necessarily deviates from the sequential search order,
sometimes dramatically and unpredictably, e.g. by distributing work at random.
This can disrupt effective search order heuristics and lead to unexpected and
highly variable parallel performance. The variability makes it hard to reason
about the parallel performance of combinatorial searches.
  This paper presents a generic parallel branch and bound skeleton, implemented
in Haskell, with replicable parallel performance. The skeleton aims to preserve
the search order heuristic by distributing work in an ordered fashion, closely
following the sequential search order. We demonstrate the generality of the
approach by applying the skeleton to 40 instances of three combinatorial
problems: Maximum Clique, 0/1 Knapsack and Travelling Salesperson. The
overheads of our Haskell skeleton are reasonable: giving slowdown factors of
between 1.9 and 6.2 compared with a class-leading, dedicated, and highly
optimised C++ Maximum Clique solver. We demonstrate scaling up to 200 cores of
a Beowulf cluster, achieving speedups of 100x for several Maximum Clique
instances. We demonstrate low variance of parallel performance across all
instances of the three combinatorial problems and at all scales up to 200
cores, with median Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) below 2%. Parallel solvers
that do not follow the sequential search order exhibit far higher variance,

random numbers and is allowed to stop the sequence at any time, claiming a

Krengel, Sucheston, and Garling asserts that a gambler who knows the
distribution of each random variable can achieve at least half as much reward,
in expectation, as a ""prophet"" who knows the sampled values of each random
variable and can choose the largest one. We generalize this result to the
setting in which the gambler and the prophet are allowed to make more than one
selection, subject to a matroid constraint. We show that the gambler can still
achieve at least half as much reward as the prophet; this result is the best
possible, since it is known that the ratio cannot be improved even in the
original prophet inequality, which corresponds to the special case of rank-one
matroids. Generalizing the result still further, we show that under an
intersection of p matroid constraints, the prophet's reward exceeds the
gambler's by a factor of at most O(p), and this factor is also tight.

a single memristor and combine in circuits like resistors do. Spiking is more
likely when filamentary memristors are used or the circuits have a higher
degree of compositional complexity (i.e. a larger number of anti-series or
anti-parallel interactions). 3-memristor circuits with the same memristor
polarity (low compositional complexity) are stabilised and do not show spiking
behaviour. 3-memristor circuits with anti-series and/or anti-parallel
compositions show richer and more complex dynamics than 2-memristor spiking
circuits. We show that the complexity of these dynamics can be quantified by
calculating (using partial auto-correlation functions) the minimum order
auto-regression function that could fit it. We propose that these oscillations
and spikes may be similar phenomena to brainwaves and neural spike trains and
suggest that these behaviours can be used to perform neuromorphic computation.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

compressed DNA sequence comparison computations, under various querying

test if his DNA string, $Q$, is close to a DNA string, $Y$, owned by a data
owner, Alice, but Bob does not want to reveal $Q$ to Alice and Alice is willing
to reveal $Y$ to Bob \emph{only if} it is close to $Q$. We describe a
privacy-enhanced method for comparing two compressed DNA sequences, which can
be used to achieve the goals of such a scenario. Our method involves a
reduction to set differencing, and we describe a privacy-enhanced protocol for
set differencing that achieves absolute privacy for Bob (in the information
theoretic sense), and a quantifiable degree of privacy protection for Alice.
One of the important features of our protocols, which makes them ideally suited
to privacy-enhanced DNA sequence comparison problems, is that the communication
complexity of our solutions is proportional to a threshold that bounds the
cardinality of the set differences that are of interest, rather than the
cardinality of the sets involved (which correlates to the length of the DNA

  Systems Without Using Relevance Judgments","Large-scale retrieval systems are often implemented as a cascading sequence
of phases -- a first filtering step, in which a large set of candidate
documents are extracted using a simple technique such as Boolean matching
and/or static document scores; and then one or more ranking steps, in which the
pool of documents retrieved by the filter is scored more precisely using dozens

are then taken from the head of the final ranked list. Here we examine methods
for measuring the quality of filtering and preliminary ranking stages, and show
how to use these measurements to tune the overall performance of the system.
Standard top-weighted metrics used for overall system evaluation are not
appropriate for assessing filtering stages, since the output is a set of
documents, rather than an ordered sequence of documents. Instead, we use an
approach in which a quality score is computed based on the discrepancy between
filtered and full evaluation. Unlike previous approaches, our methods do not
require relevance judgments, and thus can be used with virtually any query set.
We show that this quality score directly correlates with actual differences in
measured effectiveness when relevance judgments are available. Since the
quality score does not require relevance judgments, it can be used to identify
queries that perform particularly poorly for a given filter. Using these

problem ($\mathsf{SSUM}$) is to decide whether there exists $S \subseteq [n]$
such that $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = t$. There is a close variant of the
$\mathsf{SSUM}$, called $\mathsf{Subset~Product}$. Given positive integers
$a_1, ..., a_n$ and a target integer $t$, the $\mathsf{Subset~Product}$ problem
asks to determine whether there exists a subset $S \subseteq [n]$ such that
$\prod_{i \in S} a_i=t$. There is a pseudopolynomial time dynamic programming
algorithm, due to Bellman (1957) which solves the $\mathsf{SSUM}$ and
$\mathsf{Subset~Product}$ in $O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space.
  In the first part, we present {\em search} algorithms for variants of the
Subset Sum problem. Our algorithms are parameterized by $k$, which is a given
upper bound on the number of realisable sets (i.e.,~number of solutions,
summing exactly $t$). We show that $\mathsf{SSUM}$ with a unique solution is
already NP-hard, under randomized reduction. This makes the regime of
parametrized algorithms, in terms of $k$, very interesting.
  Subsequently, we present an $\tilde{O}(k\cdot (n+t))$ time deterministic
algorithm, which finds the hamming weight of all the realisable sets for a
subset sum instance. We also give a poly$(knt)$-time and $O(\log(knt))$-space

arising in earlier studies of network analysis. There are several equivalent
definitions of graph reassembling; in this report we use a definition which
makes it closest to the notion of graph carving. A reassembling is a rooted
binary tree whose nodes are subsets of V and whose leaf nodes are singleton
sets, with each of the latter containing a distinct vertex of G. The parent of
two nodes in the reassembling is the union of the two children's vertex sets.
The root node of the reassembling is the full set V. The edge-boundary degree
of a node in the reassembling is the number of edges in G that connect vertices
in the node's set to vertices not in the node's set. A reassembling's
alpha-measure is the largest edge-boundary degree of any node in the
reassembling. A reassembling of G is alpha-optimal if its alpha-measure is the
minimum among all alpha-measures of G's reassemblings.
  The problem of finding an alpha-optimal reassembling of a simple graph in
general was already shown to be NP-hard.
  In this report we present an algorithm which, given a 3-regular plane graph G
= (V,E) as input, returns a reassembling of G with an alpha-measure independent
of n (number of vertices in G) and upper-bounded by 2k, where k is the

edge-outerplanarity k, the number n of vertices can be arbitrarily large.) Our

  It focussed on computational and combinatorial questions regarding
triangulations, with the goal of bringing together researchers working on
various aspects of triangulations and of fostering a closer collaboration
within the computational geometry and topology community.
  Triangulations are highly suitable for computations due to their clear
combinatorial structure. As a consequence, they have been successfully employed
in discrete algorithms to solve purely theoretical problems in a broad variety
of mathematical research areas (knot theory, polytope theory, 2- and 3-manifold
topology, geometry, and others). However, due to the large variety of
applications, requirements vary from field to field and thus different types of
triangulations, different tools, and different frameworks are used in different
areas of research. This is why today closely related research areas are
sometimes largely disjoint leaving potential reciprocal benefits unused.

Oberwolfach Research Institute in 2012. Since then many new collaborations
between researchers of different mathematical communities have been
established. Regarding the computational geometry community, the theory of
manifolds continues to contribute to advances in more applied areas of the
field. Many researchers are interested in fundamental mathematical research

  mechanics on initiation of ventricular fibrillation in human heart failure","The study of pathological cardiac conditions such as arrhythmias, a major
cause of mortality in heart failure, is becoming increasingly informed by
computational simulation, numerically modelling the governing equations. This
can provide insight where experimental work is constrained by technical
limitations and/or ethical issues.
  As the models become more realistic, the construction of efficient and
accurate computational models becomes increasingly challenging. In particular,
recent developments have started to couple the electrophysiology models with
mechanical models in order to investigate the effect of tissue deformation on
arrhythmogenesis, thus introducing an element of nonlinearity into the
mathematical representation. This paper outlines a biophysically-detailed
computational model of coupled electromechanical cardiac activity which uses
the finite element method to approximate both electrical and mechanical systems
on unstructured, deforming, meshes. An ILU preconditioner is applied to improve
performance of the solver.
  This software is used to examine the role of electrophysiology, fibrosis and
mechanical deformation on the stability of spiral wave dynamics in human
ventricular tissue by applying it to models of both healthy and failing tissue.
The latter was simulated by modifying (i) cellular electrophysiological
properties, to generate an increased action potential duration and altered
intracellular calcium handling, and (ii) tissue-level properties, to simulate
the gap junction remodelling, fibrosis and increased tissue stiffness seen in
heart failure. The resulting numerical experiments suggest that, for the chosen
mathematical models of electrophysiology and mechanical response, introducing
tissue level fibrosis can have a destabilising effect on the dynamics, while
the net effect of the electrophysiological remodelling stabilises the system.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related
network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS
metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step
consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic
Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best
paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on
them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.

$k$ identical items for sale and is facing $n$ potential buyers (""agents"") that
are arriving sequentially. Each agent is interested in buying one item. Each
agent's value for an item is an IID sample from some fixed distribution with
support $[0,1]$. The seller offers a take-it-or-leave-it price to each arriving
agent (possibly different for different agents), and aims to maximize his
expected revenue.
  We focus on ""prior-independent"" mechanisms -- ones that do not use any
information about the distribution. They are desirable because knowing the
distribution is unrealistic in many practical scenarios. We study how the
revenue of such mechanisms compares to the revenue of the optimal offline
mechanism that knows the distribution (""offline benchmark"").
  We present a prior-independent dynamic pricing mechanism whose revenue is at
most $O((k \log n)^{2/3})$ less than the offline benchmark, for every
distribution that is regular. In fact, this guarantee holds without *any*
assumptions if the benchmark is relaxed to fixed-price mechanisms. Further, we
prove a matching lower bound. The performance guarantee for the same mechanism
can be improved to $O(\sqrt{k} \log n)$, with a distribution-dependent
constant, if $k/n$ is sufficiently small. We show that, in the worst case over
all demand distributions, this is essentially the best rate that can be
obtained with a distribution-specific constant.
  On a technical level, we exploit the connection to multi-armed bandits (MAB).
While dynamic pricing with unlimited supply can easily be seen as an MAB
problem, the intuition behind MAB approaches breaks when applied to the setting
with limited supply. Our high-level conceptual contribution is that even the

Gaussian elimination may turn some zeroes into nonzero values. To maintain the
matrix sparse, we would like to minimize the number $k$ of these changes, hence
called the minimum fill-in problem. Agrawal et al.~[FOCS'90] developed the
first approximation algorithm, based on early heuristics by George [SIAM J
Numer Anal 10] and by Lipton et al.~[SIAM J Numer Anal 16]. The objective
function they used is $m+k$, the number of nonzero elements after elimination.
An approximation algorithm using $k$ as the objective function was presented by
Natanzon et al.~[STOC'98]. These two versions are incomparable in terms of
approximation.
  Parameterized algorithms for the problem was first studied by Kaplan et
al.~[FOCS'94]. Fomin & Villanger [SODA'12] recently gave an algorithm running
in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)}+n^{O(1)}$.
  Hardness results of this problem are surprisingly scarce, and the few known
ones are either weak or have to use nonstandard complexity conjectures. The
only inapproximability result by Wu et al.~[IJCAI'15] applies to only the
objective function $m+k$, and is grounded on the Small Set Expansion
Conjecture. The only nontrivial parameterized lower bounds, by Bliznets et
al.~[SODA'16], include a very weak one based on ETH, and a strong one based on
hardness of subexponential-time approximation of the minimum bisection problem
on regular graphs. For both versions of the problem, we exclude the existence
of PTASs, assuming P$\ne$NP, and the existence of $2^{O(n^{1-\delta})}$-time
approximation schemes for any positive $\delta$, assuming ETH. It also implies
a $2^{O(k^{1/2-\delta})} n^{O(1)}$ parameterized lower bound. Behind these

a typed, core functional language and contribute the first relatively complete
method for constructing counterexamples for PCF programs. The method is
relatively complete in the sense of Hoare logic; completeness is reduced to the
completeness of a first-order solver over the base types of PCF. In practice,
this means an SMT solver can be used for the effective, automated generation of
higher-order counterexamples for a large class of programs.
  We achieve this result by employing a novel form of symbolic execution for
higher-order programs. The remarkable aspect of this symbolic execution is that
even though symbolic higher-order inputs and values are considered, the path
condition remains a first-order formula. Our handling of symbolic function
application enables the reconstruction of higher-order counterexamples from
this first-order formula.

algebraic geometry, best known as a procedure to enable Quantifier Elimination
over real-closed fields. However, it has a worst case complexity doubly
exponential in the size of the input, which is often encountered in practice.
It has been observed that for many problems a change in algorithm settings or
problem formulation can cause huge differences in runtime costs, changing
problem instances from intractable to easy. A number of heuristics have been
developed to help with such choices, but the complicated nature of the
geometric relationships involved means these are imperfect and can sometimes
make poor choices. We investigate the use of machine learning (specifically
support vector machines) to make such choices instead.
  Machine learning is the process of fitting a computer model to a complex
function based on properties learned from measured data. In this paper we apply
it in two case studies: the first to select between heuristics for choosing a
CAD variable ordering; the second to identify when a CAD problem instance would
benefit from Groebner Basis preconditioning. These appear to be the first such
applications of machine learning to Symbolic Computation. We demonstrate in
both cases that the machine learned choice outperforms human developed

  and Efficient Information Locking","The existence of quantum uncertainty relations is the essential reason that
some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become possible when
quantum communication is allowed. One direct operational manifestation of these
uncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information
locking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a
uniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical
key of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this
quantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about
the message, in which case the message is said to be ""locked"". Furthermore,
knowing the key, it is possible to recover, that is ""unlock"", the message. In
this paper, we make the following contributions by exploiting a connection
between uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. We
introduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to
low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also
implies an entropic uncertainty relation. We prove that random bases satisfy
uncertainty relations with a stronger definition and better parameters than
previously known. Our proof is also considerably simpler than earlier proofs.
We apply this result to show the existence of locking schemes with key size
independent of the message length. We give efficient constructions of metric
uncertainty relations. The bases defining these metric uncertainty relations
are computable by quantum circuits of almost linear size. This leads to the
first explicit construction of a strong information locking scheme. Moreover,
we present a locking scheme that is close to being implementable with current
technology. We apply our metric uncertainty relations to exhibit communication

  Decomposition","An algorithm for reversible logic synthesis is proposed. The task is, for a
given $n$-bit substitution map $P_n: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, to find
a sequence of reversible logic gates that implements the map. The gate library
adopted in this work consists of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates denoted by
$C^m\!X$, where $m$ is the number of control bits that ranges from 0 to $n-1$.
Controlled gates with large $m \,\,(>2)$ are then further decomposed into
$C^0\!X$, $C^1\!X$, and $C^2\!X$ gates. A primary concern in designing the
algorithm is to reduce the use of $C^2\!X$ gate (also known as Toffoli gate)
which is known to be universal.
  The main idea is to view an $n$-bit substitution map as a rank-$2n$ tensor
and to transform it such that the resulting map can be written as a tensor
product of a rank-($2n-2$) tensor and the $2\times 2$ identity matrix. Let
$\mathcal{P}_n$ be a set of all $n$-bit substitution maps. What we try to find
is a size reduction map $\mathcal{A}_{\rm red}: \mathcal{P}_n \rightarrow
\{P_n: P_n = P_{n-1} \otimes I_2\}$. %, where $I_m$ is the $m\times m$ identity
matrix. One can see that the output $P_{n-1} \otimes I_2$ acts nontrivially on
$n-1$ bits only, meaning that the map to be synthesized becomes $P_{n-1}$. The
size reduction process is iteratively applied until it reaches tensor product

  developing a semi-automated approach to analysis of small-N qualitative data","This paper experiments with designing a semi-automated qualitative data
analysis (QDA) algorithm to analyse 20 transcripts by using freeware.
Text-mining (TM) and QDA were guided by frequency and association measures,
because these statistics remain robust when the sample size is small. The
refined TM algorithm split the text into various sizes based on a manually
revised dictionary. This lemmatisation approach may reflect the context of the
text better than uniformly tokenising the text into one single size. TM results
were used for initial coding. Code repacking was guided by association measures
and external data to implement a general inductive QDA approach. The
information retrieved by TM and QDA was depicted in subgraphs for comparisons.
The analyses were completed in 6-7 days. Both algorithms retrieved contextually
consistent and relevant information. However, the QDA algorithm retrieved more
specific information than TM alone. The QDA algorithm does not strictly comply
with the convention of TM or of QDA, but becomes a more efficient, systematic
and transparent text analysis approach than a conventional QDA approach.

agents through strategic intermediaries (or mediators), and investigate the
cost to society due to the mediators' strategic behavior. Selfish agents with
private information are each associated with exactly one strategic mediator,
and can interact with the mechanism exclusively through that mediator. Each
mediator aims to optimize the combined utility of his agents, while the
mechanism aims to optimize the combined utility of all agents. We focus on the
problem of facility location on a metric induced by a publicly known tree. With
non-strategic mediators, there is a dominant strategy mechanism that is
optimal. We show that when both agents and mediators act strategically, there
is no dominant strategy mechanism that achieves any approximation. We, thus,
slightly relax the incentive constraints, and define the notion of a two-sided
incentive compatible mechanism. We show that the $3$-competitive deterministic
mechanism suggested by Procaccia and Tennenholtz (2013) and Dekel et al. (2010)
for lines extends naturally to trees, and is still $3$-competitive as well as
two-sided incentive compatible. This is essentially the best possible. We then
show that by allowing randomization one can construct a $2$-competitive
randomized mechanism that is two-sided incentive compatible, and this is also
essentially tight. This result also closes a gap left in the work of Procaccia
and Tennenholtz (2013) and Lu et al. (2009) for the simpler problem of
designing strategy-proof mechanisms for weighted agents with no mediators on a
line, while extending to the more general model of trees. We also investigate a

applications using a constant base raised to a fixed-point exponent making its
distribution exponential. This greatly simplifies hardware multiply, divide and
square root. LNS with base-2 is most common, but in this paper we show that for
low-precision LNS the choice of base has a significant impact.
  We make four main contributions. First, LNS is not closed under addition and
subtraction, so the result is approximate. We show that choosing a suitable
base can manipulate the distribution to reduce the average error. Second, we
show that low-precision LNS addition and subtraction can be implemented
efficiently in logic rather than commonly used ROM lookup tables, the
complexity of which can be reduced by an appropriate choice of base. A similar
effect is shown where the result of arithmetic has greater precision than the
input. Third, where input data from external sources is not expected to be in
LNS, we can reduce the conversion error by selecting a LNS base to match the
expected distribution of the input. Thus, there is no one base which gives the
global optimum, and base selection is a trade-off between different factors.

  Problem","Objective: The purpose of this study is to introduce and evaluate the
unfitted discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (UDG-FEM) for solving the
electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem. Methods: This new approach for
source analysis does not use a geometry conforming volume triangulation, but
instead uses a structured mesh that does not resolve the geometry. The geometry
is described using level set functions and is incorporated implicitly in its
mathematical formulation. As no triangulation is necessary, the complexity of a
simulation pipeline and the need for manual interaction for patient specific
simulations can be reduced and is comparable with that of the FEM for
hexahedral meshes. In addition, it maintains conservation laws on a discrete
level. Here, we present the theory for UDG-FEM forward modeling, its
verification using quasi-analytical solutions in multi-layer sphere models and
an evaluation in a comparison with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG-FEM) method on
hexahedral and on conforming tetrahedral meshes. We furthermore apply the
UDG-FEM forward approach in a realistic head model simulation study. Results:
The given results show convergence and indicate a good overall accuracy of the
UDG-FEM approach. UDG-FEM performs comparable or even better than DG-FEM on a
conforming tetrahedral mesh while providing a less complex simulation pipeline.
When compared to DG-FEM on hexahedral meshes, an overall better accuracy is

functional programming, because they make the order of effects explicit. When
translating pure code to a monadic version, we need to specify evaluation order
explicitly. Two standard translations give call-by-value and call-by-name
semantics. The resulting programs have different structure and types, which
makes revisiting the choice difficult.
  In this paper, we translate pure code to monadic using an additional
operation malias that abstracts out the evaluation strategy. The malias
operation is based on computational comonads; we use a categorical framework to
specify the laws that are required to hold about the operation.
  For any monad, we show implementations of malias that give call-by-value and
call-by-name semantics. Although we do not give call-by-need semantics for all
monads, we show how to turn certain monads into an extended monad with

http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05037v2,Reactive Control Improvisation,"Reactive synthesis is a paradigm for automatically building
correct-by-construction systems that interact with an unknown or adversarial
environment. We study how to do reactive synthesis when part of the
specification of the system is that its behavior should be random. Randomness
can be useful, for example, in a network protocol fuzz tester whose output
should be varied, or a planner for a surveillance robot whose route should be
unpredictable. However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a
way to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards
this end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control
improvisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive
control improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness
requirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over
a finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are
realizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications
given by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our
method yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm. For various other types of
specifications including temporal logic formulas, we obtain a polynomial-space
algorithm and prove matching PSPACE-hardness results. We show that all of these
randomized variants of reactive synthesis are no harder in a
complexity-theoretic sense than their non-randomized counterparts.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

well-established tool for the characterization of complex behavior in stock
markets. Following Mantegna's seminal paper, the linear Pearson's correlation
coefficient between pairs of stocks has been the usual way to determine network
edges. Recently, possible effects of nonlinearity on the graph-theoretical
properties of such networks have been demonstrated when using nonlinear
measures such as mutual information instead of linear correlation. In this
paper, we quantitatively characterize the nonlinearity in stock time series and
the effect it has on stock network properties. This is achieved by a systematic
multi-step approach that allows us to quantify the nonlinearity of coupling;
correct its effects wherever it is caused by simple univariate non-Gaussianity;
potentially localize in space and time any remaining strong sources of this
nonlinearity; and, finally, study the effect nonlinearity has on global network
properties. By applying this multi-step approach to stocks included in three
prominent indices (NYSE100, FTSE100 and SP500), we establish that the apparent
nonlinearity that has been observed is largely due to univariate
non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, strong nonstationarity in a few specific stocks
may play a role. In particular, the sharp decrease in some stocks during the
global financial crisis of 2008 gives rise to apparent nonlinear dependencies
among stocks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Angles","Locomotion is one of the most essential interaction tasks in virtual reality
(VR) with teleportation being widely accepted as the state-of-the-art
locomotion technique at the time of this writing. A major draw-back of
teleportation is the accompanying physical rotation that is necessary to adjust
the users' orientation either before or after teleportation. This is a limiting
factor for tethered head-mounted displays (HMDs) and static body postures and
can induce additional simulator sickness for HMDs with three degrees-of-freedom
(DOF) due to missing parallax cues. To avoid physical rotation, previous work
proposed discrete rotation at fixed intervals (InPlace) as a controller-based
technique with low simulator sickness, yet the impact of varying intervals on
spatial disorientation, user presence and performance remains to be explored.
An unevaluated technique found in commercial VR games is reorientation during
the teleportation process (TeleTurn), which prevents physical rotation but
potentially increases interaction time due to its continuous orientation
selection. In an exploratory user study, where participants were free to apply
both techniques, we evaluated the impact of rotation parameters of either
technique on user performance and preference. Our results indicate that
discrete InPlace rotation introduced no significant spatial disorientation,
while user presence scores were increased. Discrete TeleTurn and teleportation
without rotation was ranked higher and achieved a higher presence score than
continuous TeleTurn, which is the current state-of-the-art found in VR games.
Based on observations, that participants avoided TeleTurn rotation when
discrete InPlace rotation was available, we distilled guidelines for designing
teleportation without physical rotation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
